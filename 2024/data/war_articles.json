The general staff did not provide additional details. Russian attacks killed at least three people in different regions of eastern Ukraine, local officials said on Sunday, and two more in Lviv region, far from the frontlines. In the centre of the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, a frequent target of Russia\u2019s attacks on energy and other infrastructure, a strike hit civilian targets in the evening, said the regional governor, Oleh Synehubov. Regional news outlets said bombs were dropped on different areas of the region. No injuries were reported. Earlier on Sunday, heavy shelling killed a man in the town of Borova, south-east of Kharkiv, local prosecutors said. Police in the Donetsk region, in Ukraine\u2019s south-east, said Russian shelling hit 14 towns and villages, with two dead reported in Krasnohorivka, west of the Russian-held regional centre of Donetsk. Russian attacks on infrastructure extended well behind the frontlines. The Lviv regional governor, Maksym Kozitskyi, said two bodies were pulled from rubble after cruise missile strikes. Russian forces bombed the border territories and settlements of the Sumy region 39 times on Sunday, the Ukrainian local regional military administration said. There were 157 explosions recorded from ordnance including artillery shells, mortars, exploding drones, drone-dropped mines and grenades, and rockets fired from helicopters. Sumy has been pounded by Russian attacks in recent weeks, forcing evacuations. Over the border in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a border village came under attack. The accounts of military action from either side were not independently confirmed. \u201cOur spirit does not give up,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an Easter message. \u201cThere is no night or day when Russian terror does not try to break our lives,\u201d Zelenskiy wrote to Ukrainians on social media, following Russian missile strikes. Zelenskiy was in Bucha on Sunday alongside the prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, and several foreign ambassadors to mark two years since the city and surrounding areas\u2019 were liberated from a brutal month-long occupation by Russia at the start of the war. The Ukrainian leader laid a lamp at the town\u2019s wall of remembrance, which names the 509 civilians who have so far been identified of those killed during Bucha\u2019s occupation. France will deliver hundreds of old armoured vehicles and new surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine. The French defence minister, Sebastien Lecornu, told a French newspaper that the president, Emmanuel Macron, had asked him to prepare a new aid package, which will include old but still functional equipment, as well as new missiles. Protesters in Kyiv have demonstrated for the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war from the Azov brigade. Relatives and friends of captured soldiers, some dressed in military clothing, waved placards at passing traffic.

Drone attacks on Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city of Kharkiv killed four people, including three rescuers responding to an earlier strike, the interior minister said. At least 12 others were injured. Separately, Russian artillery fire killed two \u2013 a married couple aged 53 and 51 \u2013 in the town of New York in the eastern Donetsk region, the regional prosecutor\u2019s office said. Another strike killed a man in a tractor in the Kharkiv region, the governor said, and an aerial bomb killed an energy worker in the neighbouring Sumy region, Ukraine\u2019s energy ministry said. Zelenskiy said his forces had managed to \u201cstabilise\u201d their positions on the battlefield, despite a \u201cshortage of shells and a significant slowdown in supplies\u201d. Russian forces had made their first territorial gains in nine months with the capture of the eastern city of Avdiivka in February. Zelenskiy said on Thursday that army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi had reported \u201con all points where the Russian army had expected to have success\u201d. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said Sweden\u2019s plans to set up a Nato military base on Gotland island in the Baltic Sea were a provocation that would turn the sea into an area of geopolitical confrontation, Russia\u2019s RIA news agency reported. The ministry said on Friday this would increase risks for shipping in the Baltic. Gotland is critical for the control of the region\u2019s sea lanes and gives Sweden and its Nato allies a profound advantage in securing the waters and the airspace off Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, the Maritime Executive website has said. Russian forces claim to have entered a suburb of the city of Chasiv Yar in Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region. The claim was made by an adviser to the Russian-appointed regional head on Friday, according to Russia\u2019s RIA news agency. Chasiv Yar, about 10km (six miles) west of Bakhmut, has served as an important staging point for Ukrainian troops in the area and is now heavily fortified, it said. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Power for 350,000 residents was severed after an energy facility in the Kharkiv region was struck during Thursday\u2019s attacks, officials said. Power supply limitations were later introduced in six Ukrainian regions, grid operator Ukrenergo said. Ukrainian drones killed two people in the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine\u2019s southern Kherson region, Moscow-installed official Andrey Alekseyenko said. In the Donetsk region, two civilians were killed and nine injured in Ukrainian attacks throughout the day, the Russian-installed regional chief said. Nato members have agreed to scour their arsenals for more air defence systems to protect Ukraine from Russian ballistic missile attacks, as the military alliance marked its 75th anniversary. \u201cAllies understand the urgency,\u201d Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said after the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, met Nato counterparts in Brussels on Thursday and stressed Ukraine\u2019s call for more air defences. Kuleba said he also spoke to the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and called for more Patriot air defence systems \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. A resident of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk who helped Russia target a missile strike on a pizzeria last June has been jailed for life, prosecutors said. Thirteen people including novelist Victoria Amelina were killed when a Russian ballistic missile tore through the popular Ria Pizza restaurant on the evening of 27 June last year. The Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s office said on Thursday that the man was recruited to carry out the task by an intelligence official in the Russian-controlled part of the eastern Donetsk region, who asked him to gather information about the restaurant. A fire broke out near the central market in the southern Russian city of Kursk on Thursday after air defence units downed a drone, one of four intercepted over the region, the governor said. Roman Starovoit reported no casualties. Ukrainian strikes on Russian refineries may have disrupted more than 15% of Russian capacity, a Nato official said, adding that the alliance believed Moscow still lacked sufficient munitions and manpower to launch a successful offensive. Ukraine said it needed to completely decentralise its electricity grid to reduce its dependence on larger power stations, amid deadly Russian strikes on its energy infrastructure. The attacks were now \u201calmost continuous\u201d, said Volodymyr Kudrytsky, head of Ukrenergo, the grid operator. \u201cInstead of having 15 or 20 large power plants, we will need to build hundreds of small ones that will be more resistant to these attacks due to their dispersion.\u201d Finland said it would extend its border closure with Russia \u201cuntil further notice\u201d, after it was shut in December in response to a surge in migrant crossings. Finland, which joined Nato a year ago, has extended the closure several times, with the last extension set to expire on 14 April. The neighbouring countries share a 1,340km (830-mile) border. President Emmanuel Macron has condemned Russia\u2019s \u201cthreatening\u201d tone following rare phone talks between the French and Russian defence ministers that only served to underline the gaping gulf between Moscow and Europe two years into the invasion of Ukraine. The hour-long phone call took place as France is pulling out all the stops to host the Olympic Games in Paris this summer.

Rafael Grossi at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed at least three direct hits against the site\u2019s main reactor containment structures. Such attacks \u201csignificantly increase the risk of a major nuclear accident\u201d, he said. Russian officials at the plant claimed the site was attacked by Ukrainian military drones, including a strike on the dome of the plant\u2019s sixth power unit. Ukraine\u2019s intelligence agency has denied responsibility for the strike, saying Russian imitation strikes \u201chave long been a well known criminal practice of the invaders\u201d. Russia has been accused of systematically using illegal chemical gas attacks against Ukrainian soldiers. Ukrainian troops claimed they had been subjected to \u201calmost daily\u201d attacks from small drones dropping teargas and other chemicals. The use of such substances, which is known as CS, is banned during wartime under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will make an official visit to China to discuss the war in Ukraine. Talks scheduled on Monday and Tuesday between Russia and China will consist of bilateral cooperation as well as \u201chot topics\u201d, such as the crisis in Ukraine and the Asia-Pacific, the Russian foreign ministry said. On Saturday, the US warned allies that China had provided geospatial intelligence to Moscow in its war against Ukraine. According to reports, China has provided Russia with satellite imagery for military purposes, as well as microelectronics and machine tools for tanks. Three civilians were killed in a Russian attack on the frontline village of Guliaipole, in Ukraine\u2019s south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region, according to reports from the regional government. The Guardian could not independently verify these claims. One civilian was killed and four others were injured after Ukrainian drones were intercepted in Belgorod. A woman was killed and four more people were wounded after air defences downed Ukrainian drones on the approach to Russia\u2019s Belgorod city, according to a statement from the local governor posted on Telegram. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Kyiv will lose the war against Russia if the US congress does not approve military aid to battle Moscow\u2019s invasion. Republicans in Congress have been blocking tens of billions of dollars in military assistance for Kyiv for months. \u201cIt is necessary to specifically tell Congress that if Congress does not help Ukraine, Ukraine will lose the war,\u201d Zelenskiy said during a video meeting, adding: \u201cIf Ukraine loses the war, other states will be attacked.\u201d The president warned over the weekend that Ukraine could run out of air defence missiles if Russia keeps up its intense long-range bombing campaign.  Russia has stepped up attacks on Chasiv Yar as it seeks to build on territorial gains in recent months. Chasiv Yar is less than 30km (18 miles) from Kramatorsk, an important rail and logistics hub for the Ukrainian army. \u201cThe situation is difficult enough and tense,\u201d said Oleg Kalashnikov, spokesman for a Ukrainian army brigade deployed in the area. Russian was using infantry and air attacks, he told Ukrainian television.

Sergei Shoigu told French defence minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu that if Paris follows up on its statements about the possibility of sending a French military contingent to Ukraine, \u201cit will create problems for France itself\u201d, according to a statement from the Russian defence ministry. It didn\u2019t elaborate. French president Emmanuel Macron said in February that the possibility of western troops being sent to Ukraine could not be ruled out. French officials have since clarified that the suggestion concerned using troops for training and other operations away from frontlines. The call marked the first such contact between Russian and French defence ministers since October 2022, according to AP. France has denied Russia\u2019s claim of a discussion on potential Ukraine talks, according to Agence France-Presse. Russia said that Shoigu and Lecornu discussed the potential for talks on the Ukraine conflict during the phone call on Wednesday, but it\u2019s a claim that Paris immediately denied. \u201cFrance neither accepted nor proposed anything of the sort\u201d on the conflict, the source told AFP. Russian drones hit residences early on Thursday in Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, killing five, including three rescue workers in a repeat strike, the mayor and the regional governor said.

Reuters was unable to independently verify the accounts. Finland\u2019s president on Wednesday signed a 10-year security deal with Ukraine in Kyiv where president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he believed Russia planned to mobilise 300,000 new troops for its war by June. But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, quoted by Russian news agencies, said the Ukrainian president\u2019s assertion about a new Russian mobilisation was untrue, says Reuters. The pact signed by president Alexander Stubb and Zelenskiy made Finland the eighth Nato member this year to commit to long-term security cooperation and defence backing for Kyiv.

Asked about a possible \u20ac100bn Nato fund for Ukraine, the Polish foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, told reporters: \u201cWe support the secretary-general\u2019s efforts.\u201d The fund is a bid to shield support for Ukraine in the face of a potential return of Donald Trump to the US presidency.  The British foreign secretary, David Cameron, urged allies to boost defence spending. \u201cThe most important thing we can do to make sure this alliance continues to grow and continues to strengthen is to ensure that we all spend over 2% of our GDP on defence,\u201d he said.

Ukraine\u2019s partners are not providing Ukraine with enough air defence, the country\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told Reuters in an interview. Ukraine\u2019s lowering of its military conscription age from 27 to 25 has come into force. The change is part of an effort to replenish its depleted ranks after more than two years of war after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. The new mobilisation law came into force Wednesday, a day after Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed it, reports AP. Russian security official Nikolai Patrushev said today, without providing any evidence, that \u201cUkrainian special services\u201d were behind last month\u2019s deadly concert shooting near Moscow.

Japan\u2019s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, on Thursday called on Americans to overcome their \u201cself-doubt\u201d and referenced the war in Ukraine, as he offered a paean to US global leadership before a bitterly divided Congress. While Kishida was careful not to touch on US domestic politics, the address comes amid a deadlock in Congress on approving billions of dollars in additional military aid to Ukraine, due to pressure from hard-right Republicans aligned with Donald Trump. \u201cWithout US support, how long before the hopes of Ukraine would collapse under the onslaught from Moscow?\u201d Kishida asked. The mass use of \u201cdrop-and-forget\u201d guided bombs containing foreign components is driving Russian advances in Ukraine, with up to 500 now being fired a week, according to a Ukrainian government analysis.

Moscow and Kyiv have repeatedly accused each other of targeting the plant since Russia seized it weeks after invading Ukraine. Both countries requested an emergency meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\u2018s board after an attack on Sunday. \u201cIt is of paramount importance to ensure these reckless attacks do not mark the beginning of a new and gravely dangerous front of the war,\u201d IAEA director general Rafael Grossi said, adding: \u201cStrikes must cease.\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that any negotiations on Ukraine without Russia were meaningless, Reuters reported. \u201cWe have repeatedly said that negotiations without Russia were meaningless \u2026 President Putin has repeatedly emphasised that we remain open to the negotiation process,\u201d Peskov said.

While these atolls in the Pacific Ocean are a picture of tropical beauty, they are also home to explosive remnants of war. Eight decades after the guns fell silent, munitions left by the US and Japan still litter beaches, jungles, and lagoons and continue to pose a hidden but lethal threat. Now millions is being spent by the US and others across the Pacific to identify, remove and destroy dormant bombs, also known as unexploded ordnance. Some estimate the number of bombs \u2013 found across the region including in Fiji, Palau and Solomon Islands \u2013 could be in the hundreds of thousands. If the fusing mechanism is intact, unexploded bombs can still detonate if disturbed.

After so many years, partially exposed bombs \u2013 or suspected bombs \u2013 have been identified in the community but attempting to move them can be deadly. In 2023, the US state department launched a $1.7m project with not-for-profit Golden West Humanitarian Foundation to remove unexploded bombs on four atolls prioritised by the Marshall Islands government. California-based Golden West employs military veterans specialising in ordnance disposal, training and weapons clearing technology.    In September, a team travelled to Maloelap Atoll to recover and destroy unexploded ordnances. They plan to conduct another mission next month. Adan Morones, Golden West\u2019s Marshall Islands project manager, is a former US marine and a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. He says extensive planning and coordination is needed to deliver the necessary vehicles, generators and supplies to remote islands. Once they reach the atoll, the team is guided by locals familiar with contaminated sites. When an explosive requires detonation, the team will choose a safe disposal location and clear the area.  Marshall Islands resident Wilbert Alik has played a crucial role in the clean-up effort. Alik, director of the Marshall Islands Cultural and Historic Preservation office, acts as interpreter, community adviser and government liaison, accompanying Golden West\u2019s team to each atoll. He explains how he works with technicians to ensure safety protocols are followed and that important cultural and historical sites aren\u2019t damaged.   Related:The US funding deal is good for the Pacific. But the key is what happens next | Meg Keen and Mihai Sora    \u201cFor us Marshallese, there are lots of sites that could be just two or three palm trees that are growing there but that property associates with a legend,\u201d Alik says from the capital Majuro. \u201cLike Native Americans, there are lots of these geographical features that are very meaningful,\u201d he says. Next month Alik, Morones and his team will spend three weeks on Wotje clearing unexploded ordnance. As a former Japanese seaplane base, Wotje is dotted with ruins of concrete bunkers and crumbling structures overgrown with roots and vines.     Over generations, Wotje residents have grown accustomed to being cautious when planting crops, gathering medicinal plants, or even walking in the forest. They know a dormant baa\u1e43 (bomb) could be buried in the sand or obscured by foliage. Alik says the threat of accidentally striking an unexploded ordnance is especially high for residents who process copra \u2013 the dried flesh of coconuts. The risk rises for farmers digging smoke pits needed for making copra. Attempts to reduce the dangers are being made with risk education offered at community gatherings in local churches in parts of the Marshall Islands, teaching people how to recognise and avoid hidden bombs. The team also trains local police to document suspected bomb sites using GPS. \u2018Every bullet is one less to deal with\u2019 Still, the training has not yet reached all communities that are exposed to the risk of unexploded ordnance. There is no official tally of deaths or injuries by the bombs but reports of fatalities include a woman killed on Mili Atoll when she struck a hidden bomb while digging a cooking pit in 2016.   Interactive   Golden West president Allan Vosburgh estimates the number of unexploded ordnances throughout the Pacific to be in the hundreds of thousands. Last year, the group says it disposed of 43 bombs and projectiles on Maloelap Atoll. After the clearance and disposal on Wotje next month, they will move on to Jaluit Atoll in 2025 and Mili Atoll in 2026. Between 2020 and 2023, the US provided $8.1m in assistance to dispose of unexploded bombs in the Marshall Islands, Fiji, Palau, and Solomon Islands. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for more than 50 years and I\u2019m never going to run out of work,\u201d says Vosburgh. \u201cI\u2019m 76 and I foresee this outliving me by a long shot. But I do think we can make a lot of difference in the Pacific because in places where they\u2019re no longer shooting, every round that you clean up, every bullet you pick up is one less that you\u2019ve got to deal with.\u201d As Wotje\u2019s mayor, one of Lajar\u2019s goals is to see his atoll cleared of unexploded ordnance so that people can feel safe enough to create the places needed to enjoy their lives.  \u201cWe need to build community places,\u201d Lajar says. \u201cA gym, schools, that\u2019s what we need.\u201d", "Ukraine war briefing: Nato foreign ministers to discuss proposal for \u20ac100bn fund for Ukraine [2024-04-02T23:54:56Z]": " A Ukrainian drone struck the primary unit of the third-largest Russian oil refinery in the Tatarstan region, more than 1,100km (690 miles) from Ukraine, one of their deepest attacks into Russia yet. Russia claimed to have intercepted a drone meant to strike Tatneft\u2019s Taneco refinery, which has a production capacity of about 360,000 barrels of oil a day. Reuters reported that pictures indicated a drone hit the primary refining unit, CDU-7, at the Taneco refinery. The attacks in Tatarstan also hit a facility where Russia produces Iranian-designed Shahed drones, which are frequently used in assaults on Ukrainian territory, causing a fire. Ukraine has launched a series of attacks against Russian oil refineries in an attempt to strike at the Russian economy and limit supplies to its military.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday signed into law a measure lowering the army mobilisation age from 27 to 25. Mobilisation has been a divisive issue in a nation exhausted by more than two years of war with Russia, which has seen huge military losses. But the move comes as Ukraine lacks soldiers to battle the Russian invasion now in its third year. Nato foreign ministers will meet on Wednesday to discuss how to put military support for Ukraine on a long-term footing, including a proposal for a \u20ac100bn ($107bn) five-year fund and a plan seen as a way to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d aid for Kyiv. The proposals by Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg would give the western alliance a more direct role in coordinating the supply of arms, ammunition and equipment to Ukraine, diplomats say. The plans will be discussed during a two-day meeting in Brussels that will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of Nato and prepare for a summit of alliance leaders in Washington in July. British foreign minister David Cameron will call for Nato allies to bolster defence spending and production in support of Ukraine. \u201cAllies need to step up and spend more on defence in the face of continued Russian aggression and a more dangerous world,\u201d Cameron will say in a speech on the occasion of 75 years of Nato history.

It said Xact Project Management was hired in March 2018 for work up to $319,572 and this \u201cwas later varied in March 2019 to $999,999, one dollar below the threshold for ministerial approval\u201d. The ANAO also said a 2018 contract with Imagination (Australia) for stakeholder engagement was drafted to a value of $1.05m, before being \u201csplit into two contracts with the same supplier\u201d. These contracts for $841,875 and $207,659 were \u201csigned on the same day\u201d and did not require ministerial approval because they were each below the $1m threshold. The report did not make any findings against any of the firms mentioned in this article, including Lendlease, Sparke Helmore, Xact Project Management or Imagination (Australia). The ANAO made five recommendations to the AWM, including to maintain appropriate records on value for money and ensure \u201call officials, contractors and advisors involved in procurement activities\u201d declare conflicts of interest. Responding to the ANAO report, the AWM said it accepted the recommendations and had \u201caddressed many of these issues already and is working to close out final recommendations\u201d. \u201cAs the Report itself highlights the Memorial\u2019s Development Project is a project of national significance,\u201d the AWM said in its formal response to the findings. \u201cThe Report also notes project delivery has faced the unique challenge of keeping the Memorial open as the centre of national commemoration and that it has had to adapt to the simultaneous impacts of COVID-19 and record high construction inflation.\u201d The project, first announced in 2018 with a price tag of about $500m, has since required another $50m in funding.

We will be closing this blog soon, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian\u2019s Middle East coverage here. \n  Here is a recap of the latest developments: \n   \n   Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza has escalated into a \u201cbetrayal of humanity\u201d, the UN\u2019s humanitarian chief said on Saturday. In a statement on the eve of the six-month anniversary of the war, Martin Griffiths, the outgoing under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, called for a \u201ccollective determination that there be a reckoning for this betrayal of humanity\u201d. \n   Iran on Saturday again threatened retaliation for the deaths of seven Revolutionary Guards in a strike on Damascus, with the army chief saying his country\u2019s enemies will \u201cregret\u201d the killings. Tehran has vowed to avenge Monday\u2019s airstrike on the Syrian capital it blamed on its arch-enemy Israel, which has not commented. Chief of staff Mohammad Bagheri was speaking on Saturday at a ceremony in the central city of Isfahan to commemorate Mohammad Reza Zahedi, one of the two dead brigadier generals from the al-Quds force, the IRGC\u2019s foreign operations arm. He said Iran\u2019s response \u201cwill be carried out at the right time, with the necessary precision and planning, and with maximum damage to the enemy so that they regret their action\u201d. AFP reports that on Saturday, crowds at the gathering in Isfahan chanted \u201cdown with Israel\u201d and \u201cdown with the United States\u201d. \n   The US is on high alert and preparing for a possible attack by Iran targeting Israeli or US assets in the region in response to Israel\u2019s strike on the Iranian embassy in Syria, a US official told the Reuters news agency. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely at a high state of vigilance,\u201d the official said in confirming a CNN report that said an attack could come in the next week. \n   Israel\u2019s army said on Saturday its troops recovered the body of a hostage abducted by Palestinian militants during the 7 October attack on southern Israeli communities. \u201cThe body of the abductee Elad Katzir, who according to intelligence was murdered in captivity by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organisation, was rescued overnight from Khan Younis and returned to Israeli territory,\u201d the army said in a statement. \n   The sister of Elad Katzir has blamed Israeli authorities for his death, saying he would have returned alive had the authorities agreed to a new truce deal. \u201cElad was kidnapped from his home in Nir Oz in one piece,\u201d Carmit Palty Katzir, his sister, wrote on her Facebook page. \u201cOur leadership is cowardly and driven by political consideration, which is why this deal has not happened yet,\u201d she wrote. \n   US and Israeli negotiators are expected in Cairo over the weekend for a renewed push to reach a ceasefire-hostage deal. Ahead of the talks, US president Joe Biden wrote to the leaders of Egypt and Qatar urging them to dial up pressure on Hamas to \u201cagree to and abide by a deal,\u201d a senior administration official told AFP on Friday night. \n   Hamas said they will send a delegation of representatives, led by the group\u2019s deputy chief in Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, to Cairo on 7 April to discuss a potential ceasefire. This is in response to an invitation issued by Egyptian mediators, Hamas said on Saturday. \n   World Central Kitchen has rejected as lacking credibility the findings of an Israeli investigation led by a former general into a coordinated series of Israeli drone strikes on the charity\u2019s vehicles in Gaza this week that killed seven aid workers. While welcoming the report as a first step, WCK\u2019s founder, the celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, said: \u201cThe IDF cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza.\u201d \n   Seven children were killed in southern Syria\u2019s Daraa province on Saturday and two other people were injured, one of them a woman, when \u201can explosive device planted by terrorists\u201d detonated in the city of Sanamayn, state news agency Sana reported, quoting a police source. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor gave a different toll, saying that \u201ceight children of different ages were killed and another was wounded\u201d in the blast. \n   Hamas on Saturday said its fighters targeted three Israeli tanks in Khan Younis with missiles, inflicting casualties. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, though it said earlier that troops had engaged with gunmen in the area. \n   The UN Office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA) said in its latest flash update that, 28 children have died of malnutrition and dehydration, as of 1 April. The figures are attributed to the ministry of health in Hamas-run Gaza. \u201cIn the north, the Nutrition Cluster estimates that more than 50,000 children under five are acutely malnourished,\u201d said the OCHA\u2019s agency in the Palestinian territories in a social media post. \n   An Israeli inquiry has blamed a series of \u201cgrave errors\u201d by military personnel, including lack of coordination and misidentification, for its killing of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza through drone strikes. In an interview with the BBC, Lt Col Peter Lerner of the Israel Defense Forces said the Israeli military had been unable to recognise that the vehicles belonged to the aid organisation. \n   The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has said he hopes Israel will quickly and effectively boost aid access to Gaza, describing the situation in the region as \u201cabsolutely desperate\u201d. Noting that 196 humanitarian workers had been killed so far during Israel\u2019s campaign, Guterres said: \u201cWe want to know why.\u201d \n   Australia\u2019s foreign minister Penny Wong said on Saturday that her country had \u201cnot yet received sufficient information\u201d from Israel about the death of Lalzawmi \u2018Zomi\u2019 Frankcom and the other aid workers killed in an Israeli strike on Monday night. \u201cIt cannot be brushed aside and it cannot be covered over,\u201d Wong said. \n   Sarit Michaeli, spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem, said the strike on World Central Kitchen workers only arrested international attention because westerners were killed. \u201cThe thought that this is a unique case, that it\u2019s a rare example \u2013 it\u2019s an insult to the intelligence of anyone who has been following the situation,\u201d she said. \n   Thousands of people protested in Morocco\u2019s commercial capital Casablanca late on Friday against \u201cmassacres\u201d in the Gaza Strip and against the country\u2019s normalisation of ties with Israel. \u201cNormalisation is a hoax\u201d and \u201cDown with the occupation\u201d, protesters chanted in Casablanca. \n   Mahmud Bassal, spokesperson for Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency, told AFP on Saturday that whatever aid is reaching Gaza is \u201cabsolutely not sufficient\u201d for its 2.4 million people, with basic necessities \u201cextremely scarce\u201d particularly in northern Gaza. \u201cChildren are dying from hunger\u201d there, he said. \n   At least 33,137 Palestinians have been killed and 75,815 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said on Saturday. The latest figures from thehealth ministry, which is run by Hamas, said 46 Palestinians were killed and 65 injured in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. \n   The former UK prime minister, Boris Johnson says a western arms embargo on Israel would \u201chand victory\u201d to Hamas and has said banning arms sales to Israel would be \u201cinsane\u201d. The comments were made in his column in the Daily Mail on Friday. \n   Iranian police on Saturday announced the arrest of a senior operative of Islamic State (IS) with two other members of the group accused of planning a suicide attack during next week\u2019s celebrations marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The police said Mohammad Zaker, known as \u201cRamesh\u201d, and the other two were arrested in Karaj, west of the capital Tehran, after clashes, according to Iranian media. Eight others accompanying the men were also detained, they said. \n   Turkish authorities detained 48 people suspected of having ties to IS in connection with a shooting at an Istanbul church in January, interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X on Saturday. One Turkish citizen was killed by two IS gunmen at the Italian Santa Maria Catholic church in Istanbul in January. \n   An Iranian journalist who was stabbed outside his London home last week has returned to work, saying the \u201cshow must go on\u201d. Pouria Zeraati, who works for London-based dissident broadcaster Iran International, was knifed in the leg by a group of three unknown assailants as he approached his car in Wimbledon on 29 March. \n   \n  \n \n \n  3.17pm BST  \n  \n  Hamas on Saturday said its fighters targeted three Israeli tanks in Khan Younis with missiles, inflicting casualties, reports Reuters.  \n  There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, though it said earlier that troops had engaged with gunmen in the area. \n  \n \n \n  3.01pm BST  \n An 'explosive device' blast kills seven children in southern Syria, reports state media \n  \n  Seven children were killed in southern Syria\u2019s Daraa province on Saturday when an \u201cexplosive device\u201d detonated, AFP reports citing state media (see 14:14 BST). \n  \u201cSeven children\u201d were killed \u201cand two other people were injured, one of them a woman, when an explosive device planted by terrorists\u201d went off in the city of Sanamayn, state news agency Sana reported, quoting a police source. \n  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor gave a different toll, saying that \u201ceight children of different ages were killed and another was wounded\u201d in the blast. \n  The UK-based monitor said militias were accused of planting the device in order to target an unidentified person in the area. \n  \n \n \n  2.40pm BST  \n UN humanitarian chief calls Gaza war 'betrayal of humanity' \n  \n  Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza has escalated into a \u201cbetrayal of humanity\u201d, the UN\u2019s humanitarian chief said on Saturday, reports AFP. \n  In a statement on the eve of the six-month anniversary of the war, Martin Griffiths, the outgoing under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, called for a \u201ccollective determination that there be a reckoning for this betrayal of humanity\u201d. \n  \u201cEach day, this war claims more civilian victims,\u201d said Griffiths, who will leave his post at the end of June due to health reasons. \u201cEvery second that it continues, sows the seeds of a future so deeply obscured by this relentless conflict.\u201d \n  According to AFP, Griffiths lamented \u201cthe unconscionable prospect of further escalation in Gaza, where no one is safe and there is nowhere safe to go.\u201d \n  He added that \u201can already fragile aid operation continues to be undermined by bombardments, insecurity and denials of access.\u201d \n  \u201cOn this day, my heart goes out to the families of those killed, injured or taken hostage, and to those who face the particular suffering of not knowing the plight of their loved ones,\u201d he said in the statement. \n  \n Updated at 2.41pm BST \n \n \n  2.14pm BST  \n  \n  Reuters has a breaking news line on an explosive device that has detonated in the countryside outside the city of Daraa in southern Syria. \n  According to Syrian state media, seven children have been killed and two people have been injured. \n  More details soon \u2026 \n  \n Updated at 2.19pm BST \n \n \n  1.58pm BST  \n  \n  Here are some of the latest images on the newswires: \n   \n    \n    A woman sits beside a destroyed building in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on Friday.

This is our latest Guardian live blog on the Israel-Gaza war and the wider Middle East crisis. \n  The US is on high alert and preparing for a possible attack by Iran targeting Israeli or US assets in the region in response to Israel\u2019s strike on the Iranian embassy in Syria, a US official told the Reuters news agency. \n  \u201cWe\u2019re definitely at a high state of vigilance,\u201d the official said in confirming a CNN report that said an attack could come in the next week. \n  Iran has said it reserves the right \u201cto take a decisive response\u201d after suspected Israeli warplanes bombed Iran\u2019s embassy in Damascus on Monday. The strike killed an Iranian military commander and marked a major escalation in Israel\u2019s war with its regional adversaries. \n  More on that in a moment but first, here is a summary of the latest developments: \n   \n   The Israeli military said on Friday that it dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others for their roles in drone strikes in Gaza that killed seven aid workers on a food-delivery mission, saying they had mishandled critical information and violated the army\u2019s rules of engagement. \n   World Central Kitchen has rejected as lacking credibility the findings of an Israeli investigation led by a former general into the coordinated series of Israeli drone strikes on the charity\u2019s vehicles in Gaza. \n   The UN Human Rights Council has demanded a halt in all arms sales to Israel, highlighting warnings of \u201cgenocide\u201d in its war in Gaza, which has killed more than 33,000 people. \n   More than three dozen congressional Democrats \u2013 including representative Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker and a key Joe Biden ally \u2013 signed a letter to the president and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, urging a halt to weapons transfers to Israel. \n   The US was looking into a media report that the Israeli military has been using artificial intelligence to help identify bombing targets in Gaza, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told CNN in an interview on Thursday. \n   The Guardian has revealed the identity of the commander of Israel\u2019s Unit 8200, which is a closely guarded secret. He occupies one of the most sensitive roles in the military, leading one of the world\u2019s most powerful surveillance agencies, comparable to the US National Security Agency. Yet after spending more than two decades operating in the shadows, the controversial spy chief \u2013 whose name is Yossi Sariel \u2013 has left his identity exposed online. \n   The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said he sincerely hoped Israel quickly and effectively boosted aid access to the Gaza Strip, describing the situation in the Palestinian territory after six months of war as \u201cabsolutely desperate\u201d. He was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by reports that the Israeli military has been using artificial intelligence to help identify bombing targets in Gaza. \n   \n  \n", "Ukraine war briefing: Three killed in second day of Russian attacks on Zaporizhzhia region, says governor [2024-04-09T01:27:44Z]": " Russian missile attacks killed three people and injured at least eight more in Ukraine\u2019s southern city of Zaporizhzhia in a second day of deadly attacks on the region, its governor, Ivan Fedorov, said. Seven apartment blocks and an industrial building as well as medical and educational facilities were damaged, authorities said. Prosecutors released images showing a car buried under rubble and concrete and iron pillars that had collapsed. Another three people in the Pologivskyi district were wounded, Federov said on social media. Four guided bombs hit the town of Bilopillia in Ukraine\u2019s northern region of Sumy, killing a woman, authorities said. At least three more people were wounded in the attack that damaged shops and a city council building. The Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station said a drone had been shot down over reactor number six. The drone fell on the roof, it said on Monday, releasing a picture of the reactor, which has been shut down. Moscow said Ukraine struck the station three times on Sunday, calling the attacks \u201cvery dangerous\u201d, but Kyiv denied responsibility. The Guardian is unable to independently verify either account. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief earlier condemned an earlier strike on the Zaporizhzhia reactor. \u201cThis cannot happen,\u201d Rafael Grossi said on social media, adding: \u201cNo one can conceivably benefit or get any military or political advantage from attacks against nuclear facilities. This is a no-go.\u201d Russia has called an emergency meeting of the IAEA\u2019s 35-nation board of governors over the attacks on the nuclear plant, Moscow\u2019s ambassador to the watchdog, Mikhail Ulyanov, said. Russia has hit up to 80% of Ukraine\u2019s conventional power plants and more than half its hydroelectric plants in recent weeks, Ukraine\u2019s energy minister said. \u201cThis is the largest attack on Ukraine\u2019s energy sector\u201d since the war began, German Galushchenko said, adding that he suspected Russia had modified its weapons to now use Iranian-style explosive drones and missiles that cause more damage per attack. The UK foreign minister, David Cameron, will meet the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Tuesday on a trip to Washington involving pressing lawmakers in Congress to pass a military aid package for Ukraine. Cameron has said he will urge the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, to pass the $60bn package, which he has held up for months. Former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo added his voice on Monday to growing calls from prominent Republicans to pass the package, after some party members accused aid opponents of succumbing to Russian propaganda. Russia and China will continue their cooperation in the fight against terrorism, including through multilateral mechanisms, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said in Beijing after holding talks with China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi. \u201cI thank the Chinese side for their condolences in connection with the terrorist attack in the Moscow region on March 22 of this year, for supporting Russia\u2019s fight against terrorism,\u201d Russian news agencies cited Lavrov as saying.   France\u2019s foreign minister said it was no longer in Paris\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d to talk to Russia after differing accounts emerged from a rare phone call about last month\u2019s deadly attack on a Moscow concert hall. St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 told broadcasters France24 and RFI that the Russian officials\u2019 accounts were \u201clies\u201d. The US treasury secretary threatened sanctions on Chinese banks that support Russia\u2019s military capacity. Janet Yellen said as she wrapped up four days of talks with China that \u201cany banks that facilitate significant transactions that channel military or dual-use goods to Russia\u2019s defence industrial base expose themselves to the risk of US sanctions\u201d. The Kremlin warned that a planned German military presence in Lithuania would escalate tensions. The Nato military alliance and EU member Lithuania, which borders Russia and its ally Belarus, said earlier it would partly finance the permanent hosting of 5,000 German troops from 2027.

Two journalists covering the aftermath of the strikes were among those wounded in the city, near the war\u2019s frontline. Ivan Fedorov, the governor, said: \u201cFirst there were two missile strikes, and then, about 40 minutes later, there were other strikes at the same place \u2013 just as rescuers, police started working.\u201d Reuters TV footage showed reporters rushing to help colleagues lying injured on the ground before emergency crews arrived. A Ukrainian drone attack targeting the Morozovsk airbase in Russia killed or injured 20 members of airfield personnel and destroyed six Russian warplanes, as well as badly damaging eight others, according to officials in Kyiv. Russian defence officials, however, claimed they intercepted more than 40 Ukrainian drones and only a power substation was damaged in the barrage. Neither side\u2019s claims could be independently verified. Morozovsk airbase is used by Russian tactical bombers that launch guided bombs at the Ukrainian military and frontline towns and cities, according to a Kyiv source. Russian forces have taken control of the settlement of Vodyane in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region, Russia\u2019s defence ministry claimed on Friday. The ministry\u2019s statement \u2013 the latest of several claimed advances by Russian forces since they took nearby Avdiivka in February \u2013 could not be independently verified. Earlier on Friday, Russia\u2019s state-run RIA news agency cited an official as saying Russian troops had entered the suburbs of Chasiv Yar, farther north near Bakhmut. The Ukrainian military denied Russian advances in the town. Russian investigators claim to have found pro-Ukraine data on the phone of one of the Moscow terror attack suspects, despite evidence that an Islamic State offshoot was responsible. The data showed that on the war\u2019s second anniversary in February he had trawled for photographs of the Crocus City Hall and sent it to others, Russia\u2019s investigative committee alleged, also saying it found photos of men in camouflage holding the Ukrainian flag. Human rights experts have warned that any statements from the suspects should be met with scepticism as the men appeared to have been tortured. Pro-Russian separatists in Moldova claimed an explosive drone hit a military base, without causing injuries or major damage, three weeks after an allegedly similar incident. The strike was in Rybnitsa district, 6km (3.7 miles) from the Ukraine border, the region\u2019s ministry for state security said on Friday. \u201cThe target was a radar station that suffered minor damage. A group of investigators is on-site,\u201d it added, without directly blaming Ukraine. A Russian governor was hospitalised after being stabbed, a spokesperson has said. Andrey Chibis, governor of far northern Murmansk, was stabbed in the stomach on Thursday evening outside a cultural centre in Apatity town, where he had been holding a meeting. Chibis said in a video posted on Telegram from his hospital bed early on Friday that he had \u201ccome around\u201d after surgery and that doctors had saved his life. Chibis was sanctioned by the EU in 2022 over his support for the Kremlin\u2019s Ukraine offensive. Authorities in Russia\u2019s eastern city of Khabarovsk declared a state of emergency in an area where a \u201cradiation source\u201d was found, according to Russia\u2019s Tass news agency. It said elevated radiation levels were detected near a power pylon about 2.5km from residential buildings. Nobody had been injured or exposed to radiation so far and radiation levels would be monitored for the next two days, it said. The Kremlin has called the French president\u2019s assertions that Russia plans to disrupt the coming Paris Olympics \u201cabsolutely unfounded\u201d. Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Russia would target the Games this July and August. The UK foreign secretary will travel to the US next week and urge politicians to approve a $60bn package of aid for Ukraine which Republicans have held up for months. David Cameron said on X (formerly Twitter): \u201cBritain has put forward its money for Ukraine this year, so has the European Union. America needs to do it.\u201d Doctors Without Borders said a Russian missile strike on Ukrainian-held Pokrovsk had \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d its office in the town. The humanitarian organisation said on X that it \u201ccondemns this attack on the office, which supports its emergency medical humanitarian assistance\u201d. Japan has announced new sanctions against Russia, banning exports of 164 goods to Russia including automobile engine oil and optical equipment.

Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sparked fears that Moscow might seek to sweep west through southern Ukraine all the way to Transdniestria, linking up with its garrison there, Reuters reporte. Those fears faded as Kyiv\u2019s troops beat back Russian forces to the eastern side of the Dnipro river. The nearest front lines lie around 200 km (125 miles) from eastern Moldova. \u201cWe regard this incident as yet another provocation aimed at exacerbating the already tense situation around Transdniestria,\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. \u201cWe expect a thorough investigation into all the circumstances of what happened.

An overnight Russian drone attack on Kharkiv in Ukraine killed six people and wounded 10 others, national emergency services and the city\u2019s mayor said on Saturday. Igor Terekhov said the attack targeted Shevchenkivskyi, a northern area of Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city. Iranian-made drones carried out the attack, hitting at least nine high-rise buildings, three dormitories and a petrol station, he said on Telegram. Police said a further eight people were hospitalised \u201cwith blast injuries and shrapnel wounds\u201d. More on that story shortly. In other key developments:  Russia fired five missiles on Ukraine\u2019s southern city of Zaporizhzhia on Friday, killing at least four people, injuring 20 and damaging residential buildings and industrial facilities, the regional governor said. Two journalists covering the aftermath of the strikes were among those wounded in the city, near the war\u2019s frontline. Ivan Fedorov, the governor, said: \u201cFirst there were two missile strikes, and then, about 40 minutes later, there were other strikes at the same place \u2013 just as rescuers, police started working.\u201d Reuters TV footage showed reporters rushing to help colleagues lying injured on the ground before emergency crews arrived. A Ukrainian drone attack targeting the Morozovsk airbase in Russia killed or injured 20 members of airfield personnel and destroyed six Russian warplanes, as well as badly damaging eight others, according to officials in Kyiv on Friday. Russian defence officials, however, claimed they intercepted more than 40 Ukrainian drones and only a power substation was damaged in the barrage. Neither side\u2019s claims could be independently verified. Morozovsk airbase is used by Russian tactical bombers that launch guided bombs at the Ukrainian military and frontline towns and cities, according to a Kyiv source. Russian forces have taken control of the settlement of Vodyane in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region, Russia\u2019s defence ministry claimed on Friday. The ministry\u2019s statement \u2013 the latest of several claimed advances by Russian forces since they took nearby Avdiivka in February \u2013 could not be independently verified. Earlier on Friday, Russia\u2019s state-run RIA news agency cited an official as saying Russian troops had entered the suburbs of Chasiv Yar, farther north near Bakhmut. The Ukrainian military denied Russian advances in the town. Russian investigators claim to have found pro-Ukraine data on the phone of one of the Moscow terror attack suspects, despite evidence that an Islamic State offshoot was responsible. The data showed that on the war\u2019s second anniversary in February he had trawled for photographs of the Crocus City Hall and sent it to others, Russia\u2019s investigative committee alleged, also saying it found photos of men in camouflage holding the Ukrainian flag. Human rights experts have warned that any statements from the suspects should be met with scepticism as the men appeared to have been tortured. Pro-Russian separatists in Moldova claimed an explosive drone hit a military base, without causing injuries or major damage, three weeks after an allegedly similar incident. The strike was in Rybnitsa district, 6km (3.7 miles) from the Ukraine border, the region\u2019s ministry for state security said on Friday. \u201cThe target was a radar station that suffered minor damage. A group of investigators is on-site,\u201d it added, without directly blaming Ukraine. A Russian governor was hospitalised after being stabbed, a spokesperson has said. Andrey Chibis, governor of far northern Murmansk, was stabbed in the stomach on Thursday evening outside a cultural centre in Apatity town, where he had been holding a meeting. Chibis said in a video posted on Telegram from his hospital bed early on Friday that he had \u201ccome around\u201d after surgery and that doctors had saved his life. Chibis was sanctioned by the EU in 2022 over his support for the Kremlin\u2019s Ukraine offensive. Authorities in Russia\u2019s eastern city of Khabarovsk declared a state of emergency in an area where a \u201cradiation source\u201d was found, according to Russia\u2019s Tass news agency. It said elevated radiation levels were detected near a power pylon about 2.5km from residential buildings. Nobody had been injured or exposed to radiation so far and radiation levels would be monitored for the next two days, it said. The Kremlin has called the French president\u2019s assertions that Russia plans to disrupt the coming Paris Olympics \u201cabsolutely unfounded\u201d. Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Russia would target the Games this July and August. The UK foreign secretary will travel to the US next week and urge politicians to approve a $60bn package of aid for Ukraine which Republicans have held up for months. David Cameron said on X (formerly Twitter): \u201cBritain has put forward its money for Ukraine this year, so has the European Union. America needs to do it.\u201d Doctors Without Borders said a Russian missile strike on Ukrainian-held Pokrovsk had \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d its office in the town. The humanitarian organisation said on X that it \u201ccondemns this attack on the office, which supports its emergency medical humanitarian assistance\u201d. Japan has announced new sanctions against Russia, banning exports of 164 goods to Russia including automobile engine oil and optical equipment. The trade ministry is also expected to ban imports of Russian nonindustrial diamonds.     ", "Fate of Middle East hangs in the balance as Israel mulls its next steps  [2024-04-14T04:53:20Z]": "The prospect of a major regional war in the Middle East hangs in the balance on Sunday morning, when Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s war cabinet is due to meet to decide Israel\u2019s response to Iran\u2019s drone and missile attack. Netanyahu\u2019s ministers voted in the middle of the night to delegate that decision to the tiny war cabinet, comprising Netanyahu, defence minister Yoav Gallant and Benny Gantz, a Netanyahu opponent who joined the government as minister without portfolio after the Hamas 7 October attack, which began the spiral of violence that has brought Israel and Iran to the brink of war.   Related: US and UK forces help shoot down Iranian drones over Jordan, Syria and Iraq    These three prickly rivals will decide the next step, with the fate of the region now resting in their hands. In the nervous hours leading up to the war cabinet meeting, Netanyahu and Biden spoke by phone for 25 minutes, during which, according to some reports in the Israeli media, the US president urged restraint. Biden issued a statement minutes after the call in which he gave no explicit advice to Netanyahu but he noted that with US help, \u201cnearly all of the incoming drones and missiles\u201d had been brought down. That \u201cremarkable\u201d defensive capacity, Biden argued, was by itself \u201ca clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel\u201d. As of early Sunday morning, the only reported casualty from the aerial onslaught was a 10-year-old girl in Israel\u2019s southern desert, from the country\u2019s most marginalised community, the Bedouins. A southern military base was lightly damaged. In the run-up to the expected Iranian assault, US officials had hypothesised just such an outcome: that Iranian projectiles would fall in the desert and not cause significant casualties. In that case, the officials predicted, Washington would urge strongly against a rash Israeli response. Iran is clearly hoping for such a muted response. In a message delivered through its mission at the UN, Tehran suggested hopefully that in the wake of its retaliation: \u201cThe matter can be deemed concluded.\u201d Both Biden and the Iranians are well aware that Netanyahu would ideally like to destroy Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, which he has long seen as an existential threat to Israel. Reducing them to rubble would be very hard without US help, but it is possible that he and other Israeli hawks could try seize this opportunity to deliver that ambition. NBC News reported on Saturday night that some top administration officials are \u201cconcerned Israel could do something quickly in response to Iran\u2019s attacks without thinking through potential fallout afterward\u201d. The report said Biden had privately expressed concern that Netanyahu is \u201ctrying to drag the US more deeply into a broader conflict\u201d, citing three people familiar with the president\u2019s comments. Administration officials are well aware that Netanyahu has an incentive to keep hostilities going, as it fends off the collapse of his coalition and new elections. While the damage to Israel was minimal, Israeli officials could argue that was no thanks to Tehran, but to the reliability of Israeli air defence and its allies, most notably the US, the UK and Jordan. Jordan risked being lambasted in the Arab world for intercepting some of the Iranian drones as they crossed its airspace. That joint action, prepared in the week before the Iranian attack, almost certainly saved lives and may have fended off a wider war. It could also serve as a reminder of Israel\u2019s dependence on the US to keep Israelis safe. In the short term, Washington can draw comfort from a few signs any Israeli response will not at least be immediate. Israel has called for a UN security council session on the attack, which will happen at 4pm New York time on Sunday. It would be surprising if a counter-attack was launched before that session. Another possible sign that the response could be muted was Gallant\u2019s conversation with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, after the attacks. According to the Israeli defence ministry, Gallant \u201cemphasised that the defence establishment is prepared for any further attempts to attack the state of Israel\u201d. His comments made no mention of Israel striking back. A third positive sign in the early hours of Sunday was a reassurance from an Israeli official cited by the New York Times that \u201cIsrael\u2019s response would be coordinated with its allies\u201d. Washington is likely to remind Israel in the coming hours and days of its gains from having withstood Iran\u2019s fury, largely unscathed. The attack has for now distracted global attention from Israel\u2019s conduct of the war in Gaza. Furthermore, the Iranian attack is also likely to dispel murmurs in the US Congress about curbing weapons supplies to Israel because of Gaza. Now such restrictions can be cast by Israel\u2019s supporters as leaving America\u2019s leading ally in the Middle East defenceless in the face of the proven Iranian threat.", "Middle East crisis: UN human rights council to consider call for Israel arms embargo \u2013 as it happened [2024-04-03T14:18:03Z]": " \n  3.14pm BST  \n Closing summary \n  \n  It has gone 4pm in Gaza, Tel Aviv and Beirut, and 5pm in Sana\u2019a. We will be closing this blog soon, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian\u2019s Middle East coverage here. \n  Here is a recap of the latest developments: \n   \n   The bodies of six foreign aid workers killed in a Gaza strike are expected to be transported out via Egypt on Wednesday. Israeli bombardment killed seven staff of the US-based food charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) on Monday in an attack that UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres labelled \u201cunconscionable\u201d and \u201can inevitable result of the way the war is being conducted\u201d. The remains of the six international staff, who were killed alongside one Palestinian colleague, were set to be taken out of Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, said Marwan al-Hams, director of the city\u2019s Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital. \n   WCK founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s described the seven people killed on a WCK mission in Gaza on Monday as the \u201cbest of humanity\u201d. He wrote in a piece published in English in the New York Times and in Hebrew in Yedioth Ahronoth: \u201cThey are not faceless or nameless. They are not generic aid workers or collateral damage in war \u2026 we welcome the government\u2019s promise of an investigation into how and why members of our World Central Kitchen family were killed.\u201d \n   Joe Biden said that Israel is not doing enough to protect aid workers and has called for a swift investigation into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) drone attack in Gaza which killed seven people working for the WCK charity.\u201cThis conflict has been one of the worst in recent memory in terms of how many aid workers have been killed,\u201d the US president said, in comments that were highly critical of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. \n   Early on Wednesday, the IDF chief of staff Herzi Halevi put the strike down to \u201cmisidentification\u201d, adding that the \u201cthe strike was not carried out with the intention of harming WCK aid workers,\u201d and that it was a mistake that should not have happened. \n   Rishi Sunak called for an urgent investigation into the deaths of three British aid workers working for the WCK who were killed by an Israeli airstrike that hit an aid convoy in Gaza. A Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister \u201cwas appalled by the killing of aid workers, including three British nationals, in an airstrike in Gaza \u2026 and demanded a thorough and transparent independent investigation into what happened\u201d. \n   The British citizens killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza will be remembered as \u201cheroes\u201d, their families have said. James Kirby, 47, John Chapman, 57 and James Henderson, 33, were among seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid workers killed in strikes by the Israel Defense Forces on Monday. The family of Chapman said in a statement on Wednesday, that he had been \u201csubject to an inhumane act\u201d. \n   The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza seems likely to worsen after charities announced they are suspending operations in the territory in the aftermath of an Israeli drone attack which repeatedly targeted a clearly identified convoy of international aid workers, killing seven. Calling the decision an \u201cunprecedented step\u201d, Anera said the killings, \u201calongside the loss of numerous other aid workers and their families, has led our team to conclude that delivering aid safely is no longer feasible\u201d \n   An attack that killed aid workers, including a Polish national, in Gaza and the reaction of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu have caused \u201cunderstandable anger\u201d and are straining relations with Warsaw, Poland\u2019s prime minister said on Wednesday. \u201cMr prime minister Netanyahu, Mr ambassador Livne the vast majority of Poles showed full solidarity with Israel after the Hamas attack,\u201d Donald Tusk wrote on social media platform X. \u201cToday you are putting this solidarity to a really hard test. The tragic attack on volunteers and your reaction arouse understandable anger.\u201d \n   Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese said he had spoken with Israel\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling him that Australians were \u2018outraged\u2019 over the death of aid worker Zomi Frankcom in an Israeli airstrike. \u201cThere is a need for a thorough investigation into what happened here and prime minister Netanyahu committed to that,\u201d Albanese said, before describing Frankcom as someone \u201cwho we can all be proud of\u201d. \n   Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said Netanyahu \u201cmust change course\u201d. \u201cI would say to Mr Netanyahu that wartime does not obviate responsibility for observing international humanitarian law, including the protection of aid workers,\u201d Wong told the ABC. Wong, who also spoke with the Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz on Tuesday evening, reiterated that \u201cunless Israel, Mr Netanyahu, changes his course of action, Israel will continue to lose [international] support. We say to Mr Netanyahu: you must change course\u201d. \n   Canadian foreign minister, M\u00e9lanie Joly, called on Wednesday for a \u201cfull investigation\u201d into the killing of aid workers in Gaza, among whom was a Canadian citizen, by an Israeli airstrike. Speaking on the sidelines of a Nato foreign ministers meeting in Brussels, Joly said Israel needed to respect international law, adding Canada would make sure it does. \n   Prosecutors in the home city of the Polish aid worker killed in Gaza launched an investigation into his killing, reported state news agency PAP on Wednesday. \u201cWe have started an investigation into the killing of Polish citizen Damian Sobol on 1-2 April in the Gaza Strip as a result of an attack by the Israeli armed forces using explosives,\u201d Beata Starzecka, the deputy district prosecutor in Przemysl, told PAP. \n   \u201cWe should mourn the loss of these brave humanitarian workers, including the three British citizens that tragically were killed,\u201d David Cameron, the UK foreign secretary, told press outside the Nato summit on Wednesday. Cameron added: \u201cI welcome what the Israeli foreign minister said yesterday to me about a full, urgent and transparent inquiry into how this dreadful event was allowed to happen. And we want to see that happen very, very quickly.\u201d \n   Pope Francis expressed his \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d on Wednesday for the deaths of seven charity workers killed by an Israeli strike while they were delivering aid in Gaza. The 87-year-old pontiff said during his weekly audience at the Vatican:\u201cI pray for them and their families.\u201d He also renewed his appeal for access to humanitarian aid for the \u201cexhausted and suffering civilian population\u201d of Gaza, and for the hostages taken by Hamas to be released. \n   The UN Human Rights Council will consider a draft resolution on Friday calling for an arms embargo on Israel, citing the \u201cplausible risk of genocide in Gaza\u201d. If the draft resolution is adopted, it would mark the first time that the UN\u2019s top rights body has taken a position on the war in Gaza. \n   An ongoing Lebanese army investigation has determined that a landmine injured three UN military observers and a translator last week, a judicial official said on Wednesday. The ongoing investigation by the army and peacekeepers from the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) has yet to determine who planted the mine, a Lebanese official told AFP, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media. \n   Israel\u2019s military said on Wednesday it had obtained information that indicated a Hezbollah explosive charge had caused the blast in south Lebanon that injured three UN military observers and a translator last week. A source close to Hezbollah told AFP the Iran-backed group would \u201ccertainly not respond to the Israeli accusations\u201d, adding that the matter was in the hands of Unifil and the army. Unifil spokesperson Andrea Tenenti told AFP that preliminary reports showed \u201cthe explosion was not caused by direct or indirect fire\u201d. \n   The latest figures from the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, said 59 Palestinians were killed and 83 injured in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours. According to the statement, at least 32,975 Palestinians have been killed and 75,577 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. \n   The families of Israeli hostages have staged four consecutive nights of mass protests, joined by a resurgent anti-government movement. Thousands gathered in front of Israel\u2019s parliament on Tuesday, with former prime minister Ehud Barak blaming Netanyahu for the 7 October \u201cdisaster\u201d and demanding new elections. \n   Gen Ramazan Sharif, a spokesperson for Iran\u2019s paramilitary revolutionary guard, accused Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of using airstrikes on countries in the region as a way to divert public attention from the \u201cthe racist nature of this regime.\u201d He warned Israel over the airstrike that destroyed Iran\u2019s consulate in Damascus, on Monday, and killed 12 people, including two Iranian generals. The strike has been widely blamed on Israel, but it has not clarified its involvement, and seldom comments on attacks it makes outside its borders. \n   The Vermont senator and former US presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders told the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu: \u201cStop murdering innocent people.\u201d Sanders delivered his blunt message in an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday, a day after seven aid workers were killed by an Israeli strike in Gaza. \n   The UK government is under pressure from Tory MPs and peers to stop arming Israel after seven humanitarian aid workers were killed by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. Three Conservatives told the Guardian on Wednesday that the UK should stop exporting arms to Israel after the strike, which killed three British aid workers. \n   Lord Ricketts, who was the former permanent secretary at the UK Foreign Office, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Wednesday: \u201cSometimes in conflict, you get a moment where there\u2019s such global outrage that it crystalises a sense that things can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d Ricketts said the international community \u201cneeds to look at further steps to increase the pressure on [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu,\u201d adding that the UK should stop arming Israel. \n   The country director for American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera) in Palestine, Sandra Rasheed told Al Jazeera that the aid agency had paused its operations in Gaza. She told the news network: \u201cThis is something that we were forced to do to ensure our safety. Our staff have guided our work, and they themselves feel like there\u2019s a target on their backs.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.18pm BST \n \n \n  2.31pm BST  \n  \n  The British citizens killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza will be remembered as \u201cheroes\u201d, their families have said. \n  James Kirby, a 47-year-old former Army sniper, and John Chapman, 57, were among seven World Central Kitchen aid workers killed in strikes by the Israel Defense Forces on Monday. \n  The pair worked in the charity\u2019s security team and died alongside fellow British military veteran James Henderson, 33. \n  Kirby\u2019s family described him as a \u201cgenuine gentleman\u201d who lost his life trying to help others. \n  In a statement to the BBC, they said: \u201cAs a family, we are utterly heartbroken by the loss of our beloved James Kirby. Alongside the other six individuals who tragically lost their lives, he will be remembered as a hero. \n  \u201cJames understood the dangers of venturing into Gaza, drawing from his experiences in the British Armed Forces, where he bravely served tours in Bosnia and Afghanistan.

That investigation needs to start at the top, not just the bottom.  \n   (The strike) was a direct attack on clearly marked vehicles whose movements were known by the Israel Defense Forces. It was also the direct result of a policy that squeezed humanitarian aid to desperate levels.  \n   \n  \n \n \n  1.59pm BST  \n UN rights council to consider call for Israel arms embargo \n  \n  The UN Human Rights Council will consider a draft resolution on Friday calling for an arms embargo on Israel, citing the \u201cplausible risk of genocide in Gaza\u201d, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \n  If the draft resolution is adopted, it would mark the first time that the UN\u2019s top rights body has taken a position on the war in Gaza. \n  According to AFP, the text condemns \u201cthe use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects by Israel\u201d in populated areas of Gaza and demands Israel \u201cuphold its legal responsibility to prevent genocide\u201d. \n  The draft resolution was brought forward by Pakistan on behalf of 55 of the 56 UN member states in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) \u2013 the exception being Albania. The text is co-sponsored by Bolivia, Cuba and the Palestinian mission in Geneva. \n  AFP reports that the eight-page draft demands Israel end its occupation of Palestinian territory and immediately lifts its \u201cillegal blockade\u201d on the Gaza Strip. \n  Reportedly, it also calls upon countries to stop the sale or transfer of arms, munitions and other military equipment to Israel, citing \u201ca plausible risk of genocide in Gaza\u201d. \n  The draft, say AFP, also \u201ccondemns the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare\u201d, calls for an immediate ceasefire and \u201ccondemns Israeli actions that may amount to ethnic cleansing\u201d. \n  Last week, the UN security council in New York passed a resolution calling for a ceasefire \u2013 thanks to an abstention from Washington, Israel\u2019s closest ally. \n  The draft being brought in Geneva calls on states to ensure that the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) receives sufficient funding and demands Israel stop expanding settlements in Palestinian territories. \n  It \u201creaffirms that criticism of violations of international law by Israel should not be conflated with antisemitism\u201d. \n  The resolution condemns the firing of rockets against Israeli civilian areas and demands \u201cthe immediate release of all remaining hostages and detainees\u201d. \n  AFP reports that the council will discuss on Friday whether to adopt the resolution, alongside three other resolutions concerning Israeli settlements, the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, and human rights in the occupied Syrian Golan. \n  Israel has long accused the Human Rights Council of being biased against it. \n  \n \n \n  1.42pm BST  \n  \n  The UK government is under pressure from Tory MPs and peers to stop arming Israel after seven humanitarian aid workers were killed by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. \n  Three Conservatives told the Guardian on Wednesday that the UK should stop exporting arms to Israel following the strike, which killed three British aid workers. \n  Their intervention comes after Peter Ricketts, who was a government national security adviser during David Cameron\u2019s premiership, said the \u201ctime has come\u201d to send a signal and stop exporting arms. \n  David Jones, the Conservative MP for Clwyd West, said the Israeli strike on the aid convoy was \u201cextraordinary\u201d. \n  \u201cThe government should urgently reassess its supply of arms and deliver a stern warning to Israel about its conduct.

Over lunch with visiting EU chief, Ursula Von der Leyen, the Cypriot leader appealed for support from Brussels in handling what has been described as an unprecedented surge of refugees embarking on the sea journey from Lebanon. Last week, 15 boats carrying 800 people made the 10-hour crossing, leaving Cyprus, Christodoulides said, in \u201ca state of serious crisis\u201d. The influx, seen as a by-product of the ongoing Israeli-Hamas conflict, has stoked fears of Cyprus, the region\u2019s nearest EU member state, being overwhelmed by refugees if the war spreads into Lebanon. Commenting on the talks, also attended by Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Cyprus\u2019s government spokesperson said: \u201cThe main topic of discussion is the management of the recent increased migration flows from Lebanon, and specific ways to prevent this phenomenon through more active involvement of the EU.\u201d Christodoulides will travel to Lebanon with the island\u2019s interior and foreign ministers on Monday to discuss ways of assisting the country stop the flows.

Indeed both our prime minister had conversations with prime minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu and the foreign secretary had conversations with his opposite number\u2026 The manner in which some people are seizing on this issue and trying to hold Israel to incredibly high standards, of course it is right that we hold Israel to high standards, but I just think there is a bit of relish from some people about the way in which they are pushing this case against Israel.  Dowden said he would not go so far as to suggest this was coded antisemitism, but said people needed to remember the \u201ctrauma\u201d Israelis are suffering. \u201cOf course Israel has made mistakes, and made big mistakes, and we should hold them to account for that, but we are holding them to a very high standard,\u201d he added. His comments come after the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, warned that Britain\u2019s support for Israel is \u201cnot unconditional\u201d, and as the UK government comes under intense pressure to end arm sales to Israel.        9.02am BST       A missile has reported to have fallen near a ship southwest of the Yemeni port city of Aden.  The UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said a \u201cmissile impacted the water in close proximity\u201d to the ship. \u201cNo damage to the vessel reported and crew reported safe,\u201d it said.    UKMTO WARNING INCIDENT 062 UPDATE 001https://t.co/fX3hWupi7g#MartimeSecurity  #MarSec pic.twitter.com/bcQ6rHap1I&mdash; United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) (@UK_MTO) April 7, 2024     Security firm Ambrey also reported a \u201cprojectile\u201d hitting the water near the ship, advising vessels in the vicinity to \u201cexercise caution\u201d. The attack comes hours after two missiles targeted a ship southwest of the Yemeni port city of Hodeidah, according to both the UKMTO and Ambrey. One missile was intercepted by US-led coalition forces and the second missed the ship, UKMTO said. Houthi rebels have launched dozens of missile and drone strikes on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden since November, saying their actions are in solidarity with Palestinians during the Gaza war.       8.44am BST       Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, travelled to Oman on Sunday on the first leg of a regional tour, his ministry said, almost a week after Israel\u2019s strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus. Iran has vowed revenge after an airstrike destroyed the Iranian consulate in Damascus, killing at least 11 people, including a senior commander in the al-Quds force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Iran\u2019s leaders in Tehran described the targeting of a diplomatic mission as unprecedented and promised a harsh response. While Israel has not officially acknowledged its involvement, the incident has the potential to further destabilise the already volatile region.       8.37am BST    New round of ceasefire negotiations expected to be held in Cairo today    Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that runs Gaza, said on Saturday that they would send a delegation to Cairo for a new round of mediated talks beginning on Sunday. Hamas reiterated its demands issued in a 14 March proposal before a UN security council resolution calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip that was passed on 25 March. The demands include a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, a return of the displaced, and a \u201cserious\u201d exchange deal of Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, the statement said. According to Israeli figures, about 250 Israelis and foreigners were taken during the Hamas attacks. About 129 hostages remain unaccounted for after being kidnapped. Israel has repeatedly vowed that it will fight on in the Palestinian territory until Hamas is destroyed. As refenced in our opening summary, the CIA director Bill Burns is reportedly expected to attend Sunday\u2019s talks, along with the Qatari foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and possibly an Israeli delegation. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is under mounting pressure from the relatives of hostages who are being held captive in Gaza and from world leaders, including the US president, Joe Biden, his most powerful ally. Biden last week called for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d in Gaza following the news of the Israeli airstrikes killing seven employees of the international food charity World Central Kitchen.    Updated at 8.41am BST     8.23am BST    Opening summary    Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s continuing coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. It has been six months since Israel launched its war on Gaza in response to the 7 October Hamas attacks on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage. On Sunday, negotiators plan to meet in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, to try to reach a ceasefire deal, which has so far remained elusive despite several high-level attempts. According to some media reports, CIA director Bill Burns and Qatari prime minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani will join negotiators from Egypt, Israel and Hamas.    More on that in a moment. Here is a summary of some of the day\u2019s other main events:  The Israeli military has published the names of four soldiers killed in Gaza, bringing its losses in ground fighting to 604. The four commandos died on Saturday in southern Gaza, the military said in a statement. Hamas had claimed an ambush against Israeli forces in the southern town of Khan Younis on Saturday. Israel launched airstrikes on eastern Lebanon early on Sunday, hitting what it said were Hezbollah infrastructure sites after the armed group downed an Israeli drone over the country. The Israeli army said fighter jets struck a military complex and three other infrastructure sites belonging to Hezbollah in the eastern city of Baalbek. It said the latest attack was in response to Iran-backed Hezbollah\u2019s downing of a drone in Lebanese airspace. UK support for Israel is \u201cnot unconditional\u201d, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, David Cameron, wrote in the Sunday Times, after the killing of seven World Central Kitchen staff by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. \u201cOf course our backing is not unconditional,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe expect such a proud and successful democracy to abide by international humanitarian law, even when challenged in this way.\u201d Tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets on Saturday to protest against Benjamin Netanyahu. Organisers said about 100,000 people converged at a Tel Aviv crossroads renamed, Democracy Square, since mass protests against controversial judicial reforms last year. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has escalated into a \u201cbetrayal of humanity\u201d, the UN\u2019s humanitarian chief said. In a statement on the eve of the six-month anniversary of the war, Martin Griffiths, the outgoing under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, called for a \u201ccollective determination that there be a reckoning for this betrayal of humanity\u201d. Iran has threatened retaliation for the deaths of seven Revolutionary Guards in a strike on Damascus, with the army chief saying his country\u2019s enemies will \u201cregret\u201d the killings. Tehran has vowed to avenge Monday\u2019s airstrike on the Syrian capital it blamed on Israel. Israel\u2019s army said on Saturday its troops recovered the body of a hostage abducted by Palestinian militants during the 7 October attack on southern Israeli communities. \u201cThe body of the abductee Elad Katzir, who according to intelligence was murdered in captivity by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organisation, was rescued overnight from Khan Younis and returned to Israeli territory,\u201d the army said in a statement. The sister of Elad Katzir has blamed Israeli authorities for his death, saying he would have returned alive had the authorities agreed to a new truce deal. \u201cElad was kidnapped from his home in Nir Oz in one piece,\u201d Carmit Palty Katzir, his sister, wrote on her Facebook page. \u201cOur leadership is cowardly and driven by political consideration, which is why this deal has not happened yet,\u201d she wrote.     Updated at 9.29am BST  ", "Middle East crisis: Israel says investigation into its air strike that killed aid workers in Gaza to take weeks \u2013 as it happened [2024-04-04T14:57:00Z]": " \n  3.57pm BST  \n Summary of the day so far \n  \n  Here is a summary of the day\u2019s key events. For more updates on the conflict, our U.S. blog has the latest. \n   \n   An Israeli spokesperson has suggested to the BBC that findings of the investigation into the killing of seven humanitarian aid workers in Gaza may come in \u201cthe next few days\u201d. Shimon Friedman, a spokesperson for Cogat, an Israeli defence ministry body, said. \u201cWe want this investigation to be as thorough as possible.\u201d Officials had signalled earlier in the day that the investigation could take weeks. The international food charity World Central Kitchen has called for an \u201cindependent, third-party investigation\u201d into the Israeli strikes and asked Australia, Canada, Poland, the US and the UK, whose citizens were killed, to join them in demanding the inquiry.  \n   WCK asked the Israeli government to retain all the necessary evidence, including communications, video and audio recordings of the fatal strikes on their convoy. The bodies of six foreign staff of WCK were repatriated from Gaza via Egypt on Wednesday, while the Palestinian employee was buried in Gaza. \n   A Hamas official has said there has been no progress in Gaza ceasefire talks despite the movement showing flexibility. Reuters reports that Hamas official Osama Hamdan said Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was placing obstacles hindering both parties from reaching an agreement, and that he is \u201cnot interested\u201d in releasing Israeli hostages. \u201cThe occupation government is still evading, and negotiations are stuck in a vicious circle,\u201d Hamdan said. Netanyahu has been accused domestically of prolonging the war for his own political reasons, and protesters in Tel Aviv today were carrying pictures of him as they appealed for the Israeli government to do more to get the release of the captives. \n   Diplomatic tensions rose between Poland and Israel over the death of Polish aid worker, Yacov Livne, in Gaza. Earlier this week, Israel\u2019s ambassador to Poland, Yacov Livne, said on social media that \u201canti-Semites will always remain anti-Semites, and Israel will remain a democratic Jewish state that fights for its right to exist. Also for the good of the entire Western world.\u201d Polish President Andrzej Duda called the comment \u201coutrageous\u201d and described the ambassador as \u201cthe biggest problem for the state of Israel in relations with Poland.\u201d The Foreign Ministry in Warsaw also said that it was summoning the ambassador for a meeting. Earlier this week, Polish prosecutors opened a homicide investigation into Sob\u00f3l\u2019s death. \n   Australia\u2019s prime minister Anthony Albanese said it was not good enough for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to say that \u201cthis is just a product of war\u201d. Poland\u2019s prime minister Donald Tusk called for an apology, compensation and investigation from Israel. \n   Aid organisations working in Gaza have said they are demanding the Israeli military improve and adhere to security procedures intended to keep their workers safe, following the Israeli airstrikes that killed all seven members of a convoy of humanitarian workers from World Central Kitchen (WCK). Several aid groups have suspended operations. \n   Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza have \u201cbordered on the reckless\u201d, a former head of MI6 has said, amid pressure on the UK government to stop arms sales. Alex Younger, who led the Secret Intelligence Service between 2014 and 2020, said it was \u201chard not to conclude that insufficient care is being paid to the collateral risks of these operations, one way or another\u201d. \n   Israel\u2019s military has said it has again attacked what it described as \u201cterrorist infrastructure\u201d inside Lebanon. The IDF release said, \u201cEarlier today, a number of launches were identified crossing from Lebanon toward the areas of Betzet and Shlomi in northern Israel. The IDF struck the sources of fire. A short while ago, IDF fighter jets struck terrorist infrastructure in the areas of Yaroun, Aynata, and Maroun El Ras.\u201d \n   At least 33,037 Palestinians have been killed and 75,668 have been injured in the Israeli military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Thursday. The Hamas-led ministry said about 62 Palestinians were killed and 91 injured in the past 24 hours. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify casualty figures being issued during the conflict. \n   In its daily operational briefing Israel\u2019s military claims to have killed \u201ca number of terrorists\u201d and to have \u201clocated weapons over the past day\u201d. It also claims it has \u201cstruck terrorist infrastructures and eliminated terrorists using tank fire\u201d. None of the information supplied by the Israeli military has been independently verified, and Israel has limited the access of journalists into the Gaza Strip. \n   The charity Oxfam has calculated that people in northern Gaza are being forced to survive on 245 calories a day, which is less than 12% of the average intake needed by people. It says it amounts to less than the calorific value of a can of fava beans. \n   More than 600 prominent lawyers in the UK have signed a letter that calls for end to UK arms exports to Israel, as a \u201cmeasure to prevent\u201d genocide. Signatory Michael Mansfield KC said on Thursday \u201cYou can see that it\u2019s very obvious every time a picture comes back there\u2019s nothing left. And you\u2019ve got people starving to death. And I say, and I think some of the others on the letter would say, effectively, we\u2019ve reached genocide already.\u201d \n   In the UK, senior Conservative peer Sir Nicholas Soames has joined calls for the UK to stop arming Israel after an airstrike killed seven aid workers in Gaza. Asked whether the UK should ban arms exports to Israel, Soames said: \u201cIt\u2019s probably time that that happened now, yes, I think if we\u2019re determined to show that we are not prepared to countenance these ongoing disasters.\u201d \n   A spokesperson for the UK\u2019s main opposition Labour party has said that the UK government should publish legal advice given to it about whether Israel is breaking international law, to ensure that the UK government is not breaking the law itself by continuing to allow arms sales to Israel. A majority of voters in Britain back a ban on arms sales to Israel, according to a YouGov poll. \n   Demonstrators in Tel Aviv again blocked a highway calling for the immediate release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and other groups inside Gaza. They called on Israel\u2019s government to do more to strike a deal for a pause to fighting to facilitate their release. \n   A political row has developed in Israel over plans to allow members of Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox community, the Haredim, to be conscripted, ending a longstanding religious exemption from military service. Supporters of both sides of the argument are threatening to walk out of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s wartime national coalition if they do not get their way. \n   Israel has halted leave for its combat units. A statement said \u201cIn accordance with the situational assessment, it has been decided that leave will be temporarily paused for all IDF combat units. The IDF is at war and the deployment of forces is under continuous assessment according to requirements.\u201d \n   Israeli media reports a step up in GPS jamming inside the country, believed to be a preparation for a potential attack from Iran, which has vowed revenge after an airstrike on its consulate in Damascus killed several senior military commanders. Iran has blamed Israel, which has neither confirmed or denied it carried out the strike. \n   \n  \n \n \n  3.33pm BST  \n Israel respond to Iran revenge threat \n  \n  Reuters reported on Thursday that the Israeli military halted leave for all combat units amid concerns over an escalation of violence.  \n  \u201cIn accordance with the situational assessment, it has been decided that leave will be temporarily paused for all IDF (Israel Defence Forces) combat units,\u201d the military said in a statement. It added, \u201cThe IDF is at war and the deployment of forces is under continuous assessment according to requirements.\u201d \n  Earlier this week, Iran vowed to take revenge on Israel for an airstrike that killed two of its generals and five military advisers at its embassy compound in Damascus. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied their involvement in the attack.  \n  But IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari posted on X, saying, \u201cThe directives of the Home Front Command remained unchanged. There is no need to buy generators, store food and withdraw money from ATMs. As we have done until today, we will immediately update any change if it is in an official and orderly manner.\u201d \n  The U.S. treasury department also announced on Thursday a fresh wave of Iran-related counterterrorism sanctions against Oceanlink Maritime DMCC and its vessels.  \n  \n \n \n  2.59pm BST  \n  \n  In Israel, public broadcaster Kan is reporting that IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari is considering whether to give a public broadcast tonight concerning preparations for an increased threat from Iran. Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s war cabinet is also expected to meet tonight. \n  \n \n \n  2.56pm BST  \n  \n  There is a little more detail on the statement from Hamas official Osama Hamdan that there is no progress on ceasefire talks. \n  During a press briefing in Beirut, Reuters reports he said Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was placing obstacles hindering both parties from reaching an agreement, and that he is \u201cnot interested\u201d in releasing Israeli hostages. \n  \u201cThe occupation government is still evading, and negotiations are stuck in a vicious circle\u201d, Hamdan said. \n  Netanyahu has been accused domestically of prolonging the war for his own political reasons, and protesters in Tel Aviv today were carrying pictures of him as they appealed for the Israeli government to do more to get the release of the captives. \n  \n \n \n  2.38pm BST  \n Hamas official: no progress in Gaza ceasefire talks \n  \n  Reuters reports that Hamas official Osama Hamdan said on Thursday there has been no progress in Gaza ceasefire talks despite the movement showing flexibility. \n  Israel had said on Tuesday its delegation had returned from Cairo having formulated a new proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release which was to be presented to Hamas by moderators. \n  \n \n \n  2.35pm BST  \n  \n  As its military offensive on Gaza has continued, a political row has developed in Israel over plans to allow members of Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox community, the Haredim, to be conscripted, ending a longstanding religious exemption from military service. \n  Supporters of both sides of the argument are threatening to walk out of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s wartime national coalition if they do not get their way. \n  In Jurasalem, Lorenzo Tondo and Quique Kierszenbaum have spoken to members of the community for the Guardian, and you can read that here: \u2018I will never join the army\u2019: ultra-Orthodox Jews to defy Israeli court orders \n   \n    Related: \u2018I will never join the army\u2019: ultra-Orthodox Jews to defy Israeli court orders  \n   \n  \n \n \n  2.30pm BST  \n  \n  Maj Gen Aharon Haliva, the Israel Defense Forces Intelligence Directorate chief has warned that Israel faces \u201ccomplex days\u201d ahead and \u201cit is not certain that the worst is behind us\u201d. \n  Haliva was speaking after it was announced that senior intelligence officer Brig Gen Amit Saar was standing down due to a diagnosis of cancer. Saar has been criticised in Israeli media for security lapses that allowed the 7 October Hamas attack to break through Israel\u2019s border with the Gaza Strip. \n  \n \n \n  2.25pm BST  \n  \n  In the UK senior Conservative peer Sir Nicholas Soames has joined calls for the UK to stop arming Israel after an airstrike killed seven aid workers in Gaza. \n  Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill, said the UK should send a \u201cmessage\u201d about Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. \n  Asked whether the UK should ban arms exports to Israel, Soames said: \u201cIt\u2019s probably time that that happened now, yes, I think if we\u2019re determined to show that we are not prepared to countenance these ongoing disasters.\u201d \n  He added that: \u201cIsrael have every right to go after Hamas, there\u2019s no shadow of doubt about that.\u201d \n  The UK\u2019s contribution to Israel\u2019s arsenal \u201cwould be tiny and it\u2019s probably parts more than anything else\u201d, Soames said, but stopping the exports would send a message. \n  \u201cI say this with real sadness because, I mean, first of all, what happened was an absolute tragedy, and secondly, it was absolutely inexcusable,\u201d Soames said of the strike that killed the aid workers, including three Britons, on Monday. \n  \u201cThis is not a fog of war issue with these [aid workers]. They were quite clearly \u2013 the whole thing had been deconflicted, organised, everything, and something has gone very, very wrong, and the Israelis need to really get a grip of all this. \n  \u201cAnd secondly, these people were doing the most wonderful work to provide aid to starving Palestinians \u2026 I think it is the message that matters.\u201d \n  Read more of Eleni Courea\u2019s report here: Grandson of Winston Churchill joins calls for UK to stop arming Israel \n   \n    Related: Tory peer Nicholas Soames joins calls for UK to stop arming Israel  \n   \n  \n \n \n  2.21pm BST  \n  \n  Speaking to the BBC, Cogat spokesperson Shimon Friedman has suggested a faster timetable for Israel\u2019s report into the killing of seven humanitarian aid workers than had earlier been suggested by officials. \n  He told the BBC: \n   \n   We want this investigation to be as thorough as possible in order for us to learn whatever needs to be learned so that we can prevent these things from happening again in the future.

It asked the governments of Australia, Canada, the US, Poland, and the UK to join the call. \n  \n \n \n  12.30pm BST  \n  \n  Reuters reports that Amos Yadlin, a former Israeli intelligence chief, has said this Friday is the most likely timing of any revenge attack by Iran for the suspected Israeli strike that killed Iranian military commanders at its consulate in Syria\u2019s capital Damascus earlier this week. \n  The news agency quotes Yadlin saying \u201cI will not be surprised if Iran will act tomorrow. Don\u2019t panic. Don\u2019t run to the shelters. Be tuned for tomorrow and then, depending on the consequences of the attack, it may escalate.\u201d \n  Tomorrow is the final Friday in Ramadan, which is celebrated as Quds Day in Iran and beyond as a pro-Palestinian day named after the Arabic name for Jerusalem, al-Quds. \n  Israeli media has reported that Israel has stepped up the jamming of GPS signals inside the country in an effort to reduce the effectiveness of guided missiles or drones. \n  Iran has blamed Israel for the strike on Damascus, and vowed revenge. \n  \n \n \n  11.56am BST  \n  \n  Poland\u2019s president Andrzej Duda has echoed an earlier call by the country\u2019s prime minister Donald Tusk for an apology, compensation and investigation from Israel into the death of Damian Sob\u00f3l, 35, the Polish national who was killed when Israel attacked a World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid convoy inside the Gaza Strip on Monday. \n  Tusk had said \u201cWe will expect \u2026 an immediate explanation of the circumstances and compensation for the victims\u2019 relatives.\u201d \n  Reuters reports Duda had critical words for Israel\u2019s ambassador to Poland during a televised speech on Nato\u2019s anniversary, saying:  \n   \n   The authorities in Israel speak in a very subdued and sensitive manner. Unfortunately, their ambassador in Poland is unable to maintain such delicacy and this is unacceptable. Today the ambassador is making these relations very difficult. This is my assessment. \n   \n  Poland has summoned Israel\u2019s ambassador after comments he made earlier in the week. In a post on social media on Tuesday, Yacov Livne wrote: \n   \n   The extreme right and left in Poland accuse Israel of intentional murder in yesterday\u2019s attack, which resulted in the death of members of a humanitarian organization, including a Polish citizen. \n   Deputy speaker of the Sejm and leader of the Confederation, Krzysztof Bosak, claims that Israel is committing \u201cwar crimes\u201d and terrorizing humanitarian organizations to starve the Palestinians.  \n   This is the same Bosak who to this day has refused to condemn the massacre committed by Hamas on 7 October and whose party colleague, a right-wing extremist, used a fire extinguisher to extinguish the Hanukkah menorah that we lit in the parliament in Warsaw. \n   Conclusion: anti-Semites will always remain anti-Semites, and Israel will remain a democratic Jewish state that fights for its right to exist and also for the good of the entire western world. \n   \n  Diplomatic relations between Israel and Poland have been tense in recent years as Poland moved to pass a law criminalising accusing Poles of collective complicity in Nazi war crimes carried out on German-occupied Polish territory, and also attempting to pass a statue of limitations on property restitution, which would prevent reclamation of property seized during the second world war. \n  \n \n \n  11.36am BST  \n  \n  Karyn Beattie, a team leader for Save the Children\u2019s response in Gaza, has spoken to the Guardian\u2019s Harriet Sherwood about the situation after the deadly Israeli airstrike on a World Central Kitchen aid convoy on Monday that killed seven humanitarian aid workers. She writes: \n  Every time we travel [within Gaza], we tell the Israeli military. Our information goes to the UN in Jerusalem and they send it to Cogat and the Gaza CLA [two Israeli government bodies] who coordinate with the Israeli military. We do this for every single movement, and we don\u2019t set off until we have confirmation that all the information has been logged. \n  Our vehicles are clearly marked with Save the Children logos on the roof, sides and bonnet, and sometimes we have little flags attached to the vehicles too. \n  We don\u2019t wear flak jackets and helmets because the Israelis don\u2019t allow us to bring body armour into Gaza through the Rafah crossing. Very few aid agency staff have body protection. \n  World Central Kitchen (WCK) has a different way of coordinating its movements with the Israeli military. They\u2019ve developed a good system of direct contact. They\u2019re very well known to the Israelis. They constantly update their movements. \n  That\u2019s why we\u2019re all absolutely shocked at the airstrikes \u2013 the fact that it was WCK. It has shaken confidence in the system. I feel quite nervous now, I\u2019ll be honest. \n  We all expect an increase in international staff who ask to leave. If people want out, that\u2019s their right. If they want to go, it\u2019s my job to get them out. \n  The day of the airstrikes on the WCK convoy, I sent messages to my family to tell them they were going to hear about aid workers being killed but I was okay. All of us are constantly aware that our families are worried. You think, is it okay for me to put them through this? \n  Read more of what Karyn Beattie told Harriet Sherwood here: \u2018I feel quite nervous now\u2019: Gaza aid worker on safety concerns after Israeli attack \n   \n    Related: \u2018I feel quite nervous now\u2019: Gaza aid worker on safety concerns after Israeli attack   \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.32am BST  \n Oxfam: people in northern Gaza having to survive on just 245 calories a day \n  \n  The charity Oxfam has calculated that people in Gaza are being forced to survive on 245 calories a day, which is less than 12% of the average intake needed by people. It says it amounts to less than the calorific value of a can of fava beans. \n  Stating that over 300,000 people are believed to still be trapped in northern Gaza, unable to leave, and after Israel\u2019s decision to prevent Unrwa delivering aid to the north, Oxfam says its analysis is based on the latest available data used in the recent Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis for the Gaza Strip. \n  A coalition of aid agencies has previously warned of imminent famine in northern Gaza. \n   Interactive \n   \n  Oxfam said that the total food deliveries allowed into Gaza for the entire 2.2 million population \u2013 since last October - amounted to an average of just 41 per cent of the daily calories needed per person. It claimed that less than half the number of food trucks needed to reach the daily 2,100 calories intake for everyone are currently entering Gaza. \n  In a statement, Oxfam quoted one mother trapped in northern Gaza saying: \n   \n   Before the war, we were in good health and had strong bodies. Now, looking at my children and myself, we have lost so much weight since we do not eat any proper food, we are trying to eat whatever we find \u2013 edible wild plants or herbs daily just to survive. \n   \n  Amitabh Behar, Oxfam International Executive Director said: \n   \n   Israel is making deliberate choices to starve civilians. Imagine what it is like, not only to be trying to survive on 245 calories day in, day out, but also having to watch your children or elderly relatives do the same. All while displaced, with little to no access to clean water or a toilet, knowing most medical support has gone and under the constant threat of drones and bombs. \n   \n  Oxfam says it has repeatedly called for a permanent ceasefire, the return of all hostages from Gaza, the release of unlawfully detained Palestinian prisoners, for countries to immediately stop supplying arms to Israel and for full humanitarian aid access. \n  \n Updated at 12.06pm BST \n \n \n  11.21am BST  \n  \n  A spokesperson for the UK\u2019s main opposition party has said that the government should publish legal advice given to it about whether Israel is breaking international law, to ensure that it is not breaking the law by continuing to allow arms sales to Israel. \n  Appearing on the GB News television channel, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: \n   \n   Specifically in the case of British arms exports to Israel, the law of the UK is very, very clear. If there is any possibility of anything exported from the UK being involved in a serious violation of a humanitarian law, it cannot be exported from the UK. \n   The Government will have had legal advice on that specific to the conflict in Gaza. We\u2019ve asked them to publish that legal advice. \n   \n  At the weekend it was reported by the Observer that government lawyers had written advice that said Israel is breaking humanitarian law, and that the government had not yet acted on that advice. \n  \n \n \n  11.08am BST  \n  \n  Overnight the Guardian reported that in the UK more than 600 prominent lawyers have signed a letter that calls for end to UK arms exports to Israel, as a \u201cmeasure to prevent\u201d genocide. \n  Speaking about the 17-page letter, which also amounts to a legal opinion, human rights lawyer Michael Mansfield KC told listeners to Times Radio that \u201ceffectively, we\u2019ve reached genocide already\u201d. \n  PA Media quotes him saying: \n   \n   You can see that it\u2019s very obvious every time a picture comes back there\u2019s nothing left. And you\u2019ve got people starving to death. And I say, and I think some of the others on the letter would say, effectively, we\u2019ve reached genocide already. \n   \n  \n \n \n  10.52am BST  \n  \n  Demonstrators in Israel have again blocked a highway in Tel Aviv calling for the immediate release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and other groups inside Gaza. They are calling on Israel\u2019s government to do more to strike a deal for a pause to fighting to facilitate their release. \n  About 240 people were abducted as hostages by Hamas during the 7 October attack inside souther Israel. About 100 have subsequently been released, and some, including Shani Louk and three men killed by IDF forces while escaping, are known to be dead.

For Haaretz, Avi Scharf writes: \n   \n   Until now, the GPS disruptions were mainly felt in the north of the country, from the Haifa area to the Lebanese border, and the GPS map services showed users that they were in Beirut. A similar phenomenon was felt in the south of the country, according to which the GPS devices showed users in Cairo. In the last week, the phenomenon increased, and the devices in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv also show that the user is in Cairo or in Beirut, respectively. \n   \n  GPS disruption is intended to thwart guided drone and missile attacks. \n  \n \n \n  10.12am BST  \n  \n  Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting for Al Jazeera from Rafah, has said there has been \u201cno let-up in airstrikes in the Gaza Strip\u201d. \n  He writes: \n   \n   Last night, there was a surge of attacks in Rafah where two homes full of displaced people were targeted, killing at least seven Palestinians and injuring three others. This is what Gaza\u2019s supposed \u201csafe zone\u201d witnesses every night. Israel\u2019s surveillance drones and fighter jets rarely leave the skies. \n   \n  On Monday, Israeli legislators approved a bill paving the way for a ban on Al Jazeera and other international news outlets perceived as posing a threat to security.

This was over 1.5km, 1.8km, with a very defined humanitarian convoy that had signs in the top, in the roof, a very colourful logo that we are obviously very proud of. It\u2019s very clear who we are and what we do.\u201d \n  Netanyahu has said of the attack, which included Australian aid worker Zomi Frankcom among the seven victims, that it was \u201ca tragic case of our forces unintentionally hitting innocent people in the Gaza Strip,\u201d adding \u201cthis happens in wartime\u201d. \n  Anthony Albanese, Australia\u2019s prime minister, described this response as \u201cnot good enough\u201d. \n  \n \n \n  9.52am BST  \n  \n  Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that one Palestinian has been killed by Israeli security forces in Ya\u2019bad, south of Jenin, in the occupied West Bank. \n  \n \n \n  9.46am BST  \n  \n  A former UK home secretary, which is the equivalent to an interior minister, has said Israel is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d in breach of international humanitarian law. \n  Suella Braverman, speaking to the BBC during a visit to Israel, said: \n   \n   The suggestion itself is absurd and, frankly, an insult to Israel who have been going above and beyond the necessary requirements to ensure that civilian casualties are limited, to ensure that aid is received onto the Gaza Strip and distributed. \n   I have seen evidence myself, in terms of very up-to-date photographic evidence, of plentiful food packages and trucks of food, water and medicines getting to the people of Gaza. \n   \n  Since the attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy on Monday many aid agencies have paused operations inside the Gaza Strip, and a coalition of aid agencies has previously warned that famine is imminent in the territory. \n  Braveman\u2019s comments come amid reports that UK government lawyers have given the government advice that Israel is breaking international law, which the government has not acted upon. A majority of voters in Britain back a ban on arms sales to Israel according to recent polling. \n  Yesterday Braverman posted a picture of herself visiting Israel to social media, saying she had \u201cmet with senior military and political figures\u201d. \n   \n   \n    Today I met with senior military &amp; political figures in Israel to discuss the war in Gaza &amp; the tragic strike on the aid convoy.

This is sometimes interpreted as a measure meant to ward off guided missiles. \n  Israel has neither confirmed nor denied carrying out an airstrike on Damascus on Monday, but Iran has vowed revenge for the attack, which struck its consulate in the Syrian capital that killed three top commanders in Iran\u2019s al-Quds force and four other officers. \n  \n \n \n  9.13am BST  \n Israel halts all leave for IDF combat units amid threat of revenge from Iran for Damascus strike \n  \n  Israel has halted leave for its combat units. In a statement this morning the IDF said: \n   \n   In accordance with the situational assessment, it has been decided that leave will be temporarily paused for all IDF combat units. The IDF is at war and the deployment of forces is under continuous assessment according to requirements. \n   \n  The move comes after the killing of Iranian commander Mohammad Reza Zahedi in a suspected Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus in Syria has ratcheted up regional tension further. \n  On Tuesday, Iran\u2019s supreme national security council said it had decided on a \u201crequired\u201d response to the Damascus strike. Iran\u2019s president Ebrahim Raisi, who chaired the meeting to discuss the response, said Iran would retaliate at the time of its own choosing, while supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said \u201cWe will make them regretful about the crime and similar acts.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  9.06am BST  \n Poland's foreign minister: Israel appears to have been 'willing to sacrifice seven innocent people' \n  \n  In an interview with the BBC in the UK, Poland\u2019s foreign minister has said that the targeting of the World Central Kitchen humanitarian aid convoy on Monday showed that Israeli forces \u201cseem to have been willing to sacrifice seven innocent people\u201d in order to target what they considered was one Hamas operative. \n  Rados\u0142aw Sikorski told listeners to the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \n   \n   The Israeli chief of staff says this was a case of mistaken identity and that they thought there was a terrorist among them. \n   But even if there was, they seem to have been willing to sacrifice seven innocent people for someone who was not an immediate danger. \n   These are moral hazards that I do not think are acceptable. \n   \n  \n \n \n  8.55am BST  \n  \n  In the UK, a former head of MI6, the country\u2019s foreign intelligence service, has said that the way Israel\u2019s military has been acting in Gaza has \u201cbordered on the reckless\u201d. \n  Speaking on a BBC podcast, and referring to the multiple strikes that killed seven humanitarian aid workers on Monday, PA Media reports Alex Younger said: \n   \n   My view is that what happened is essentially systematic of an approach to targeting that has, on occasion, bordered on the reckless. \n   [It] fundamentally undermines therefore what must be Israel\u2019s political objectives, which is to sustain some moral high ground and some moral purpose. \n   It\u2019s hard not to conclude that insufficient care is being paid to these collateral risks of these operations, one way or another. \n   \n  \n \n \n  8.40am BST  \n Palestinian death toll in Gaza from Israeli military offensive rises above 33,000 people \n  \n  At least 33,037 Palestinians have been killed and 75,668 have been injured in the Israeli military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Thursday. \n  Reuters reports the Hamas-led ministry said about 62 Palestinians were killed and 91 injured in the past 24 hours. \n  In additions to the deaths in Gaza, over the same time period over 400 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli security forces or Israeli settlers inside the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. \n  Israel began its military campaign after the 7 October Hamas attack inside southern Israel which killed about 1,140 people, and during which about 240 people were seized and abducted as hostages. About 134 hostages are still believed held captive by Hamas and other anti-Israeli groups inside Gaza. Not all of the hostages are thought to still be alive. \n  Since it began ground operations inside Gaza on 27 October, Israel says it has lost 256 soldiers in battle, with about 1,500 wounded. \n  During the conflict it has been reported that about 200 humanitarian aid workers and about 100 journalists have been killed, making it one of the deadliest conflicts on record for these groups. \n  It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify casualty figures being issued during the conflict. \n  \n \n \n  8.02am BST  \n  \n  Reuters has spoken with Israelis who have been displaced from their communities in the far north of the country, close to the UN-drawn blue line that has separated Israel from Lebanon since 2000. \n  Israel evacuated a number of communities, totalling about 60,000 people, almost immediately after the 7 October attack in southern Israel. There has been an almost constant exchange of fire between Israel\u2019s military and Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli forces inside Lebanon. \n  Shay Hanegbi said they had only expected the evacuation to last a few weeks, but \u201cIt has ended up going on and on. You don\u2019t see the end. We feel adrift.\u201d \n  Natalie Levy, 29, has been displaced with her husband and two young children from Liman, 2 miles from Lebanon. She said that after the 7 October Hamas attack, \u201cI felt like we were next.\u201d \n  Israel has long feared an attack from the north, and a security official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, told the news agency: \n   \n   What we saw in the south on 7 October was basically Hamas \u201cstealing the thunder\u201d from Hezbollah. If anything, Hezbollah is more of a border threat than Hamas was. \n   \n  There were appeals for peace among the displaced. Sarit Oved, displaced from kibbutz Matsuva, said \u201cI don\u2019t want any more loss of life, on either side.\u201d \n  Levy said \u201cThe people of Gaza that are not involved in terror are going through a very hard time. And my heart is with them. But my heart is also with the people of Israel who are also going through a hard time.\u201d \n  Reuters notes that about 90,000 people have also been displaced in Lebanon, being forced to move north away from the blue line. Israeli military strikes inside Lebanon have killed about 270 Hezbollah fighters and about 50 civilians. \n  Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, and partially occupied parts of the country from 1985 to 2000. \n  \n \n \n  7.50am BST  \n  \n  Overnight the Palestinian news agency Wafa, citing the foreign ministry of Oman, reported that \u201ca number of wounded Palestinians affected by the Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip have arrived in the Sultanate to receive treatment.\u201d \n  It said that Oman\u2019s foreign ministry thanked Egypt for facilitating the transportation of the wounded. \n  \n \n \n  7.45am BST  \n  \n  Israel\u2019s military has issued its daily operational briefing in which it claims to have killed \u201ca number of terrorists\u201d and to have \u201clocated weapons over the past day\u201d.

In February a coalition of broadcasters wrote an open letter appealing for the Israeli government to allow more access for foreign journalists, without success. Casualty counts being issued during the conflict also cannot be independently verified. \n  Authorities in Gaza state that over 32,000 people have been killed as a result of the continuous Israeli aerial bombardment and ground offensive inside Gaza since 7 October.

All three vehicles were carrying civilians; they were marked as WCK vehicles; and their movements were in full compliance with Israeli authorities, who were aware of their itinerary, route, and humanitarian mission. \n   An independent investigation is the only way to determine the truth of what happened, ensure transparency and accountability for those responsible, and prevent future attacks on humanitarian aid workers. \n   \n  The charity said it had asked the Israeli government to retain all the necessary evidence. \n  Previously WCK founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s said: \n   \n   This was not just a bad luck situation where \u2018oops\u2019 we dropped the bomb in the wrong place.

I am Martin Belam and I will be with you for the next while. \n  US President Joe Biden and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will speak on Thursday in their first call since an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers in Gaza, according to a US official. \n  That comes after the US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin urged Israel to take concrete steps to protect aid works and Palestinian civilians in a call with the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant on Wednesday. He said in a post on social media: \u201cI expressed my outrage at the Israeli strike on a World Central Kitchen humanitarian aid convoy\u201d. The US appears to have made no move, though, to limit the arms supply to Israel. \n  More on that in a moment but first, here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: \n   \n   Israel is facing mounting international pressure to justify its conduct in the war in Gaza as the bodies of six foreign aid workers killed in a drone attack were repatriated to their families. Seven members of World Central Kitchen (WCK) were killed when a drone repeatedly hit their convoy of three cars, which were clearly identified as belonging to the charity, after it left an aid warehouse in the central town of Deir al-Balah on Monday night. \n   Early on Wednesday, the IDF chief of staff Herzi Halevi put the strike down to \u201cmisidentification\u201d, adding that the \u201cthe strike was not carried out with the intention of harming WCK aid workers,\u201d and that it was a mistake that should not have happened. \n   Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday that Israel\u2019s explanation for the deaths was \u201cnot good enough\u201d. The dead included citizens of Australia, Britain and Poland as well as Palestinians and a dual citizen of the US and Canada. \n   Aid organisations working in Gaza have said they are demanding the Israeli military improve and adhere to security procedures intended to keep their workers safe, following Israeli airstrikes that killed all seven members of a convoy of humanitarian workers from World Central Kitchen (WCK). \n   The Israeli military\u2019s bombing campaign in Gaza used a previously undisclosed AI-powered database that at one stage identified 37,000 potential targets based on their apparent links to Hamas, according to intelligence sources involved in the war. In addition to talking about their use of the AI system, called Lavender, the intelligence sources claim that Israeli military officials permitted large numbers of Palestinian civilians to be killed, particularly during the early weeks and months of the conflict. \n   Three former supreme court justices, including the court\u2019s former president Lady Hale, are among more than 600 lawyers, academics and retired senior judges warning that the UK government is breaching international law by continuing to arm Israel. \n   A majority of voters in Britain back a ban on arms sales to Israel, according to a YouGov poll. One of the first up-to-date assessments of whether Israel is losing public support in key allied states, the research also suggests most people believe the Israeli government is violating human rights in Gaza. \n   The UN Human Rights Council will consider a draft resolution on Friday calling for an arms embargo on Israel, citing the \u201cplausible risk of genocide in Gaza\u201d. If the draft resolution is adopted, it would mark the first time that the UN\u2019s top rights body has taken a position on the war in Gaza. \n   Israeli minister Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet and main rival of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has called for snap parliamentary elections in September, as pressure builds over the war in Gaza. \n   \n  \n", "Chequebook journalism is nothing new, but allegations in court about Spotlight\u2019s practices have left insiders \u2018gobsmacked\u2019 | Weekly Beast [2024-04-05T02:14:24Z]": "Claims made by a former Channel Seven producer in a federal court defamation case this week that the network reimbursed Bruce Lehrmann for illicit drugs and sex workers are \u201castonishing\u201d and \u201csleazy\u201d if true, journalists and media ethics experts say. TV producer Taylor Auerbach has alleged that other expenses incurred while trying to secure an interview with Lehrmann for Spotlight included a giant steak, Thai massages, accommodation and a round of golf \u2013 on top of an estimated $104,000 in rent. Outside court, Seven has denied that it condoned or authorised the alleged payments to Lehrmann referred to in Auerbach\u2019s affidavit before he gave evidence on Thursday. It has previously acknowledged that it paid his rent for a year. After Auerbach\u2019s testimony, Seven released a statement, referred to in court on Friday, saying: \u201cSeven did not reimburse Bruce Lehrmann for expenditure that has allegedly been used to pay for illegal drugs or prostitutes, and has never done so. Seven notes the matter remains before the courts \u2026 As previously stated, Seven did not condone or authorise the alleged payments to Mr Lehrmann referred to in the affidavits recently made public. The person involved admitted to the misuse of a Seven corporate card and all unauthorised expenses were immediately reimbursed. Seven has acted appropriately at all times.\u201d The television episode that eventuated, Trial and Error, had attracted 600,000 viewers and was shortlisted for a Walkley award \u2013 the entry criteria include declaring any payments, benefits or gifts given in exchange for access (the nomination was eventually revoked).   Related: Claims of sex, drugs and credit cards: five key takeaways from Taylor Auerbach\u2019s evidence at the Bruce Lehrmann defamation trial     Some outlets have used chequebook journalism for decades, but the allegations made by Auerbach have astounded journalists and the public. Andrew Dodd, the director of the University of Melbourne\u2019s Centre for Advancing Journalism, said using rent and gifts instead of cash was an \u201cadaptation\u201d of chequebook journalism. \u201cIt looks and feels sleazy \u2026 the [alleged] behaviour is gobsmacking.\u201d If the allegations were true, Seven needed to turn the spotlight on itself, Dodd said. Denis Muller, a senior research fellow at the centre, speaking generally, said media organisations needed to ask themselves what the motive was in cases where they considered paying, and what the motive of the recipient was. \u201cDoes the fact that money\u2019s changed hands affect the credibility of the material?\u201d he said. \u201cDo you disclose to your audience that you\u2019ve received the information you\u2019re giving them as a result of payment?\u201d Muller said it was \u201castonishing\u201d that the types of transactions alleged by Auerbach \u201ccould play any part at all in a relationship between a media organisation and a source\u201d. Both Muller and Dodd said the allegations could further erode public trust in journalism. The veteran ABC journalist Quentin Dempster said that although chequebook journalism had been around for years, it was \u201chighly problematic\u201d. \u201cThe ethical point to be made is that any arrangement for exclusivity in return for any money should be clearly, transparently disclosed to the audience so that they can make an assessment of the credibility of the information they\u2019re about to receive,\u201d he said. Biased facts? Amid concerns about surging misinformation and disinformation online, the Institute of Public Affairs has once again gone to war with fact-checking units. On 1 April, the IPA released a report into AAP FactCheck, RMIT FactLab and RMIT ABC Fact Check, claiming they were guilty of left-wing bias. The IPA claimed that 94% of checks related to the pandemic targeted critics of the official Covid response; that 81% of checks related to climate change and energy policy \u201ctargeted critics\u201d of those policies; and that 65% of checks of political figures were \u201cfavourable to left-of-centre politicians\u201d \u2013 by which it meant Labor, the Greens, the teals and other \u201cprogressive independents\u201d.  The report found that \u201cthe only rational explanation\u201d for those figures was \u201cideological bias\u201d, but did not interrogate whether the checks themselves were accurate.    The report, which was embraced by Sky News and the Murdoch press, used those statistics to argue against the government\u2019s planned misinformation laws. Andrea Carson, a political communication professor at La Trobe University, wrote in the Conversation in March that \u201cthe politicisation of fact-checking \u2013 a longstanding feature of the sector in the US\u201d \u2013 had reached Australia. And the new ABC News Verify \u2013 which will replace the RMIT ABC Fact Check in June \u2013 was likely to be targeted, she said.   Related: Facing facts: ABC pulls the plug on RMIT factchecking collaboration    \u201cOur study\u2019s findings suggest that accusations of left-wing bias levelled at the ABC, particularly by right-wing partisans, may intersect with its fact-checking role with RMIT, and foreshadows criticisms that its new unit might encounter,\u201d she wrote.

Dick\u2019s dreary prank Blame the public holiday perhaps, but April Fools\u2019 Day pranks barely got a foothold in the media this year. Not like on 1 April 1978, when fledgling billionaire entrepreneur Dick Smith towed a barge covered in a sheet and shaving cream into Sydney Harbour and duped people into thinking he\u2019d towed it there from Antarctica. He would carve up the \u201cDickenberg One\u201d into \u201cDicksicles\u201d to go into drinks, he said, before the rain melted the hoax away.    His trick this year was a bit more dreary: he called into Ben Fordham Live with an unbelievable \u201cscoop\u201d. ABC chair Kim Williams asked him to be the unpaid director of news and current affairs for a day, he said. The backstory is that the ABC had to correct a fact-check on Smith\u2019s renewable energy claims. How droll. These days it\u2019s the \u201cprankvertising\u201d by corporations that is the main source of hoaxes on April Fools\u2019 Day.

Singo sings praises of BRS On to another rich Australian injecting himself into the news. The ad man John Singleton raised eyebrows when he took out a full-page ad in The Australian to pay tribute to Ben Roberts-Smith.

Under a headline that read \u201cAn apology to Ben Roberts-Smith. From a Coward\u201d, Singleton wrote that he dodged the Vietnam draft. He went on to accuse the media of \u201cgossip\u201d and to thank Roberts-Smith for the killing of Afghan soldiers. \u201cHe killed as soldiers do, but is now guilty of doing his job whilst risking his life for us,\u201d he wrote.    Industry leaders \u2013 according to the advertising, marketing and media company B&amp;T \u2013 said it was an \u201cawful stain\u201d on the industry, reflective of a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d culture, and that his use of the phrase \u201cyellow peril\u201d had racist undertones. The ad stated: \u201cNow it\u2019s yellow peril time again. Bring in China. We follow blindly against China. We buy anything from them and they don\u2019t buy anything from us. Did it hurt them? No. \u201cBut us? Cost us plenty. It killed our biggest export earners: iron ore, gas, wine, agriculture. Madness.\u201d The Weekly Beast has approached Singleton for comment.

The Weekly Beast asked Bita if she was aware of the these previous comments from Johns, the chair of the organisation, but hadn\u2019t heard back by the time of publication. China\u2019s advice for Australian journos In yet another shock accusation about media tactics, China has accused the Australian press of trying to spread western democratic values. Communist party mouthpiece the Global Times says the media is stirring up trouble and threatening regional peace by emphasising democracy and freedom. Prompted by a 60 Minutes report on China\u2019s aggression in Fiji, the Global Times published a piece referring to various anonymous sources attacking the Australian media for relying on information from anonymous sources. \u201cEfforts by some Australian media sources to \u2018spread\u2019 Western democratic values and increase their external propaganda in Fiji are increasing, the Global Times learned from some sources in Fiji, who are direct witnesses to the Australian media\u2019s sneaky manoeuvres to sow discord between Fiji and China,\u201d the Times reported, adding that analysts were warning media outlets \u201cto return to the right track of playing a more positive role in promoting cooperation and regional peace than stirring up trouble\u201d. Australian media \u201cemphasising the shared values of \u2018democracy and freedom\u2019\u201d was \u201caimed at creating doubts about or distancing from China\u2019s political system and ideology\u201d.", "Zomi and her colleagues were saving lives. Their deaths deserve our outrage | Tim Costello [2024-04-03T04:03:29Z]": "Zomi Frankcom was only 43. She was one of our finest Australians. Self-giving, courageous and compassionate; in her life we see the expression of the deepest and truest values of what we aspire to be, indeed, of what it should mean to be an Australian. Her death along with six other aid colleagues from World Central Kitchen should never have happened. World Central Kitchen had done everything right in communicating clearly with the IDF their plans for food delivery and displaying their logos clearly. An IDF spokesperson acknowledged this, saying World Central Kitchen had responded to Israel\u2019s needs also. They were humanitarian and neutral.   Related: Zomi Frankcom\u2019s family say Australian aid worker killed in Israeli airstrike was \u2018doing the work she loves\u2019    Her death triggered me because it could have been me or any of my colleagues. We all follow the same protocols in delivering aid in war \u2013 communicating with the military transparently. We all rely on international humanitarian law for protection following these protocols, as we are neutrals. Zomi was part of the food lifeline to keep people in Gaza alive. Humans need about 2,100 calories a day, or if in a food basket, 661g of food. This amounts to 1,388 tonnes of food a day that must be trucked in for a population of 2.1 million people. Because of the Israeli blockade on Gaza these trucks have been going for many years. It is nothing surprising or new. But since the barbaric Hamas attack on 7 October and the war, we now are seeing Palestinian children starving and 300,000 to 500,000 people in Gaza at risk of famine. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has offered a full investigation of this tragedy but rather glibly said this sort of thing happens in war. No, it does not. Accountability cannot mean just a \u201cwar defence\u201d and should mean that someone in Israel may be charged for their deaths. Zomi and her colleagues were humanitarians saving lives. That is what aid organisations do in all conflict zones and we do it under the coordination of the UN\u2019s Office for Humanitarian Affairs. Our every move is logged and checked with the military and this thing does not happen. Netanyahu\u2019s response smacked to me of impunity and recklessness. And the world has until recently been wringing its hands while the innocent deaths (now more than 32,000) of women and children in Gaza has been beamed on to our television news for the last six months. We have seen in the past the equivocation from our leaders to assert a simple proposition: namely that an innocent Palestinian life is equal to an innocent Jewish life. That is what my faith teaches me and what universal human rights means. And in the binary rush of Netanyahu and Hamas to claim victimhood to win political support we ignore that humans can simultaneously be both victims and perpetrators. Both Netanyahu and Hamas oppose a two-state solution and both need and feed off each other.   Related: Gaza aid convoy strike: what happened and who were the victims?    We can predict our leaders\u2019 response in saying, well, Israel has a right to defend itself but it must do so proportionately and subject to international law. But what happens when they don\u2019t? It leaves us feeling overwhelmed. And we find it so unbearable and feel so impotent that we look away. Zomi and her colleagues did not look away. They were not impotent nor paralysed. They put their lives on the line as have more than 200 other aid workers who the UN reports have died in this war so far in Gaza. This is why I sense a tipping point. I was pleased to hear our PM call for accountability and particularly Penny Wong to speak of this as being an outrage. It is an outrage. Zomi deserves our outrage as do all innocents in this war. \u2022 Tim Costello is executive director of Micah Australia and senior fellow at the Centre for Public Christianity", "Before Dawn review \u2013 Anzac drama needed a bigger budget or a better script [2024-04-04T14:00:43Z]": "Watching Before Dawn, it is quickly obvious that this first world war drama didn\u2019t have a budget big enough to stage blockbuster scale battlefield recreations \u2013 instead, there\u2019s plenty of scenes following characters inside trenches, the camera poised below ground level. Director Jordan Prince-Wright exploits the restricted spatiality of these settings, often keeping shots tight and human-oriented, with scant locational details. The cover of night also helps. It reportedly cost $900,000 in earthworks to dig the trenches, transforming farmland in Esperance, Western Australia, into environments that can plausibly \u2013 at a push \u2013 resemble terrain in war-torn Europe.   Related: The Sympathizer, Ripley and Scoop: what\u2019s new to streaming in Australia in April    The marketing materials for Before Dawn do a good job impersonating a bells-and-whistles production but the film itself is another matter: there were times, particularly early on, when I couldn\u2019t help but think, \u201cThese are just actors performing in a hole in the ground.\u201d You can feel Prince-Wright and his cast and crew bending over backwards to achieve things better resourced productions pull off much more easily, giving the experience a slight tang of desperation, and perhaps diverting attention from areas where it needed work \u2013 such as the script, which brings nothing really new to the table and lacks a compelling arc.             The film follows Levi Miller\u2019s Jim Collins, a virtuous young man who leaves the family sheep station to serve in the war, deployed with fellow Anzacs to the western front. Before Dawn begins with battlefield imagery \u2013 rats skulking around, soldiers navigating muddy trenches \u2013 before jumping back to Jim at home. The film feels quite unsettled in its establishing minutes, before stabilising into an experience that deploys the sorts of scenes and messages we\u2019ve seen many times before, often in far superior productions. Soldiers push through perilous terrain, share moments of bonding, encounter death and horrible hardship, deliver melancholic reflections accompanied by an orchestral score, et cetera.  Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning  Miller is a bankable actor (he is particularly impressive in the 2021 swimming drama Streamline) but his performance here, like the film itself, lacks gravitas. He isn\u2019t enough to lift a run-of-the-mill production that struggles to maintain dramatic interest. It is reasonably successful in some aspects, though \u2013 for instance, in its portrayal of camaraderie between very young men in tragic circumstances. The producers have declined to say how much the film cost to make, but it doesn\u2019t look like a lot. Budgets are never an indication of quality \u2013 in fact, big ones come with all sorts of consequences, alluded to in Orson Welles\u2019 great quote: \u201cThe enemy of art is the absence of limitations.\u201d But money and resources can be particularly important in genres such as science fiction, period dramas and war films, especially if they\u2019re based in environments with particular visual expectations and reference points. To really pull off a film like Before Dawn, and keep us engrossed during long slabs of minimal action, the dialogue and performances needed to be top-notch. A fresh perspective is also important in a genre that\u2019s been so comprehensively explored. This speaks to the greatness of Jonathan Glazer\u2019s The Zone of Interest: a genuinely unique film that observes war through a different prism.   Related: The Zone of Interest review \u2013 Jonathan Glazer\u2019s unforgettable Auschwitz drama is a brutal masterpiece    Before Dawn might have also benefited from contemplating what exactly the Anzacs were fighting for. An interesting response to this question can be found in Charles Chauvel\u2019s 1940 film Forty Thousand Horsemen, when Chips Rafferty\u2019s character, a member of the Australian Light Horse, answers: \u201cI suppose it\u2019s for the right to stand up on a soapbox in the Domain. The right to tell the boss what he can do with his job if we don\u2019t like it. And the right to start off as a roustabout and finish up as prime minister.\u201d Chauvel steps out of the trenches, so to speak, to engage in broader social discussions \u2013 something that is so rare in war films, including this one.

Related: Ed Husic accuses Israeli government of \u2018systematic failure\u2019 over death of Zomi Frankcom    Israel, in its submissions to the International Court of Justice, rejected \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d any claims that incidents of starvation in Gaza were a direct result of its deliberate acts and omissions. It maintains that its military operations in Gaza are a legitimate response to Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack on southern Israel. But the fatal drone strikes last week on three cars carrying seven aid workers, including Australian Zomi Frankcom, have led to a ratcheting up of international pressure on Israel. The Israeli military labelled the incident \u201ca grave mistake\u201d stemming from \u201cmistaken identification\u201d. The National Council of Churches in Australia, which has 18 member churches, said it was \u201cdismayed by news of the deaths of the seven aid workers\u201d. Its president, Rev John Gilmore, said there could be \u201cno excusing this terrible action, nor for starvation coming from the impact of the war\u201d. Israel announced late last week that it would reopen a key crossing into Gaza and allow more aid through another crossing and a port after a warning from Joe Biden that future US support would depend on concrete action to protect civilians. But the Acfid chief executive, Marc Purcell, said Israel continued to block the UN agency Unrwa from delivering aid in northern Gaza, even though \u201call objective observers believe Unrwa is the only show in Gaza that can deliver assistance at scale\u201d. The Israeli government has accused Unrwa of complicity with Hamas and argues aid should be channelled through other organisations.

He also cited comments by the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, that if Hamas did not release hostages \u201cthe only thing that needs to enter Gaza are hundreds of tons of [Israeli air force] explosives, not an ounce of humanitarian aid\u201d. Purcell said sanctions were merited because the Australian government had long pledged to uphold international rules and norms and \u201cyou can\u2019t pick and choose when to act when egregious humans rights violations occur\u201d. The executive director of the Australian Global Health Alliance, Dr Selina Namchee Lo, said there was \u201ca vicious cycle between malnutrition and illness\u201d. She said it was \u201cunconscionable to continue to withhold access to life-saving food aid from those who desperately need it\u201d. The president of the Australian National Imams Council, Shadi Alsuleiman, said the worsening conditions facing the people of Gaza had prompted the ICJ to call for \u201cunhindered provision at scale\u201d of urgently needed aid. Israel denies blocking aid, saying any shortages are a result of logistics failures by humanitarian organisations or Hamas diverting supplies. But Israeli inspections have been seen as a major hindrance to the flow of aid, with aid agencies and diplomats complaining about arbitrary definitions of what may be a security risk.

After almost a decade in immigration detention he was told on Saturday morning that, within hours, he would be deported to Sierra Leone, a country he left at five years of age after his father, a police officer, was killed in the civil war. In Australia he has a mother, Gloria; a partner, Princess George; and an 11-year-old son, Joshua; all of whom are Australian citizens. In Sierra Leone he has nobody.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  But that is where the Australian government plans to send him, after his application for a protection visa was refused about four years ago. Lawyer Alison Battisson said a week ago Coker was informed he could be deported \u201con or from\u201d 6 April, but his deportation has moved with unusual haste. Battisson is concerned the government hasn\u2019t \u201cupdated its information, nobody knows what\u2019s happening in Sierra Leone\u201d. Smart Traveller warns of \u201cthe threat of violent crime and the risk of civil unrest\u201d, particularly after a failed coup attempt in late 2023.   Related: Sierra Leone imposes nationwide curfew after armed clashes in capital    Gloria, Coker\u2019s mother, said that Sierra Leone \u201cis not peaceful, they\u2019re killing people every day\u201d. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know Sierra Leone, he doesn\u2019t know anybody.\u201d After escaping to Guinea as a child, Coker came to Australia on a humanitarian visa in his teens but his visa was cancelled after a conviction for grievous bodily harm. \u201cI was doing everything right until that day,\u201d Coker said. \u201cA few boys attacked me and my friends. I was afraid \u2013 there were so many of them. One of them ended up getting stabbed. I don\u2019t know if it was me. Since then my life has been upside down.\u201d When Coker was sent to prison his partner, Princess, was pregnant with their son. After he served his sentence he was taken into immigration detention, including in Sydney, away from his family in Brisbane. He has never met his son Joshua in person, communicating only through phone and video calls. \u201cI\u2019m not a bad person \u2026 I just made one mistake,\u201d Coker said. \u201cI didn\u2019t come to this country to commit crime, I came for a better life.\u201d \u201cI just need a second chance to prove I\u2019m not a bad person. I want to be with my son. My dad was not in my life \u2026 My dad was murdered \u2013 I don\u2019t want [Joshua] going through the same, not knowing his dad.\u201d Princess George said: \u201cThey\u2019re taking him without his consent. You can\u2019t just grab somebody, without him knowing what instability he will face.\u201d \u201cWhats going to happen with his son? His son is a citizen. What happened to human rights in all of this?\u201d \u201cJoshua will be fatherless \u2026 He always cries and says \u2018why can Dad never come to my soccer game, all my friends have their dad\u2019. \u201cHe\u2019s going to lose focus and crash, he\u2019s going to be depressed.\u201d Shortly after noon on Saturday, Coker said his flight would depart at 3:30pm. At the time, Battisson feared she would lose the ability to communicate with him, and that it would be \u201cgame over\u201d because Australia would never allow him to re-enter the country given his criminal record.   Related: Refugees risk being stripped of protection under \u2018draconian\u2019 Labor deportation bill, opponents say    Later on Saturday afternoon Battisson applied for an emergency injunction to prevent Coker\u2019s deportation on the basis an application for ministerial intervention she filed on 1 April had not been brought to the minister\u2019s attention. The government gave an undertaking not to remove Coker until a further court hearing. Even with the temporary reprieve, it\u2019s a scene that could be repeated more easily if the government\u2019s deportation bill passes the parliament. The bill creates powers for the immigration minister to require unlawful non-citizens to cooperate in their deportation, on the threat of a minimum of a year in prison if they refuse. The bill also expands ministerial powers to reverse protection findings. According to the government, the bill is \u201cnecessary to address circumstances where non-citizens who have no valid reason to remain in Australia and who have not left voluntarily as expected, are not cooperating with appropriate and lawful efforts to remove them\u201d. Battisson said the issue with the bill is that many people have made protection claims \u201cyears ago\u201d but \u201cthe situation on the ground has changed\u201d. She said Coker\u2019s pending deportation is part of the government\u2019s \u201cgeneral approach of out-Duttoning [Peter] Dutton\u201d, a reference to Labor\u2019s efforts to replicate the opposition leader and former home affairs minister\u2019s hard-line approach to non-citizens. \u201cWe are so incredibly hard now,\u201d Battisson said. \u201cI\u2019m surprised \u2026 they haven\u2019t invited [Coker] to reapply and reassess his claims.\u201d Gloria said: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m dying now \u2013 Australia [wants to] return my son to a country he doesn\u2019t know. All my relatives have been killed in the civil war, everybody died.\u201d \u201cWhy is Australia doing this to me? They\u2019re taking my soul away.\u201d Guardian Australia contacted the home affairs and immigration ministers, Australian Border Force, and the home affairs department for comment.", "UN nuclear watchdog head condemns drone strike on Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant [2024-04-07T22:43:20Z]": "The head of the UN\u2019s atomic watchdog agency has condemned a drone strike on one of six nuclear reactors at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine, saying such attacks \u201csignificantly increase the risk of a major nuclear accident\u201d. In a statement on X, Rafael Grossi confirmed at least three direct hits against the ZNPP main reactor containment structures. \u201cThis cannot happen,\u201d the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said.   Related: Russia accused of using chemical gas attacks against Ukrainian soldiers    Grossi said it was the first such attack since November 2022, when he set out five basic principles to avoid a serious nuclear accident with radiological consequences. Russian officials at the plant claimed the site was attacked on Sunday by Ukrainian military drones, including a strike on the dome of the plant\u2019s sixth power unit.  Ukraine\u2019s intelligence agency has denied responsibility for the strike. \u201cRussian strikes, including imitation ones, on the territory of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant ... have long been a well known criminal practice of the invaders,\u201d a spokesperson told local media. The Guardian has been unable to verify the claims. According to the plant authorities, there was no critical damage or casualties and radiation levels at the plant were normal after the strikes. Later on Sunday, however, Russian state-owned nuclear agency Rosatom said three people were wounded in the \u201cunprecedented series of drone attacks\u201d, specifically when a drone hit an area close to the site\u2019s canteen. The IAEA said on Sunday that its experts had been informed of the drone strike and that \u201csuch detonation is consistent with IAEA observations\u201d. In a separate statement, the nuclear watchdog confirmed the physical impact of drone attacks at the plant, including at one of its six reactors. One casualty was reported, it said. \u201cDamage at unit 6 has not compromised nuclear safety, but this is a serious incident with potential to undermine integrity of the reactor\u2019s containment system\u201d it added. The power plant has been caught in the crossfire since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in 2022 and seized the facility shortly afterwards. The IAEA has repeatedly expressed alarm about the nuclear power plant, Europe\u2019s largest, amid fears of a potential nuclear catastrophe. Both Ukraine and Russia have regularly accused the other of attacking the plant, which is still close to the front lines. The plant\u2019s six reactors have been shut down for months, but it still needs power and qualified staff to operate crucial cooling systems and other safety features. Also on Sunday, three people were killed when their house was hit by a Russian projectile in the frontline town of Huliaipole in Ukraine\u2019s partly occupied south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said. Later on Sunday, two people were wounded in another shelling of Huliaipole. Separately, three people were wounded in Russian shelling in Ukraine\u2019s north-east Kharkiv region, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov. In Russia, a girl died and four other people were wounded when the debris of a downed Ukrainian drone fell on a car carrying a family of six people in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.", "Middle East crisis: Israel criticised for strike that killed seven aid workers in Gaza \u2013 as it happened [2024-04-02T18:28:13Z]": " \n  7.28pm BST  \n Closing Summary \n  \n  Hello again, global live blog readers, it\u2019s around 9.30pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv.

The workers were travelling in two armoured vehicles branded with the charity\u2019s logo, according to a statement released early on Tuesday. WCK said those killed were from the UK, Australia, Poland and Palestine, as well as a US-Canada dual citizen.

Around 100 tonnes, about a third, were unloaded and delivered but after these tragic events the other two-thirds are being brought back.\u201d \n   Senior western officials and ministers, including the Australian foreign minister and British foreign secretary, condemned the airstrike and called for a swift and transparent investigation into it. The EU, meanwhile, repeated the need for Israel to operate within international law amid continuing fears for the safety of aid workers bringing vital food supplies to starving Palestinians in Gaza. \n   Israel\u2019s delegation will return from Cairo having formulated a new proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas, according to reports. \n   The World Health Organization (WHO) said the destruction of al-Shifa hospital in Gaza amounted to \u201cripping the heart out\u201d of the health system of the territory. \u201cDestroying al-Shifa means ripping the heart out of the health system,\u201d WHO spokesperson, Margaret Harris, said. \u201cIt was the place people go to for the kind of care that a really good health system provides, that we in all our societies expect to have should we be in need.\u201d Israeli forces left al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on Monday after a two-week operation by special forces that left most of the major medical complex in ruins. \n   Iran\u2019s president, Ebrahim Raisi, has vowed revenge after Israeli war planes destroyed the Iranian consulate in Damascus, killing at least 11 people, including a senior commander in the al-Quds force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps. \u201cAfter repeated defeats and failures against the faith and will of the Resistance Front fighters, the Zionist regime has put blind assassinations on its agenda in the struggle to save itself,\u201d Raisi said on his office\u2019s website. \u201cDay by day, we have witnessed the strengthening of the Resistance Front and the disgust and hatred of free nations towards the illegitimate nature of (Israel). This cowardly crime will not go unanswered.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.59pm BST \n \n \n  2.35pm BST  \n  \n  American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera) has issued a press release explaining the \u201cunprecedented step\u201d it took in pausing its humanitarian operations in Gaza. \n  The charity, which helps provide emergency relief for Palestinians, said delivering aid safely in the enclave is no \u201clonger feasible\u201d, with Palestinian staff in Gaza now deeming the risk to themselves and their families as \u201cintolerable\u201d. \n  Here is Anera\u2019s statement: \n   \n   Following the targeted Israeli attack on a humanitarian aid convoy yesterday, resulting in the deaths of seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) workers, Anera is taking the unprecedented step of pausing its humanitarian operations in Gaza. \n   The killing of WCK humanitarians, occurring less than a month after the still-unexplained killing of Anera staff member Mousa Shawwa, alongside the loss of numerous other aid workers and their families, has led our team to conclude that delivering aid safely is no longer feasible. For the safety of our staff and their families, we are suspending Anera\u2019s work in Gaza. \n   Since the onset of the war on 7 October, Anera\u2019s Gaza team has provided an average of 150,000 meals daily (in collaboration with WCK), millions of medical treatments, and thousands of other critical emergency aid items. While we understand the severe consequences this suspension will have on the Palestinian population, the escalating risks associated with aid delivery leave us with no choice but to halt operations until our staff regain confidence that they can do their work without undue risk. \n   In nearly six months of conflict, this marks the first instance where our Palestinian staff in Gaza, enduring continuously hazardous conditions, have deemed the risk to their safety, and that of their families, intolerable. Anera\u2019s longstanding presence in the occupied Palestinian territories, spanning over 55 years and enduring through multiple conflicts, underscores the gravity of this decision. The unprecedented scale of the current conflict and the disregard for international law necessitate this historic pause in our operations. \n   The attack on the seven WCK aid workers constitutes a clear violation of the international court of justice\u2019s provisions, emphasizing that humanitarian workers and civilians must never be targeted. The ongoing targeting of humanitarian workers and the lack of adequate safety measures demand thorough investigation and immediate action. Israel bears the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the unhindered delivery of urgent humanitarian assistance and basic services to those in need. \n   In accordance with international law and principles of humanity, parties with effective control over a population are obligated to provide protection, ensuring the provision of essential supplies for civilian survival. Even if specific obligations under occupation laws do not apply, all parties must uphold the minimum duties outlined in international humanitarian law. Israel, as the occupying authority in Gaza, holds ultimate responsibility for obstructing the delivery of essential supplies and failing to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers. \n   We reiterate our demand for adequate security for humanitarian and health workers, journalists, and all civilians, and call for an immediate and enduring ceasefire. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.36pm BST \n \n \n  2.26pm BST  \n Aid delivered to Gaza via maritime corridor being returned to Cyprus after deadly Israeli airstrike \n  \n  In the aftermath of the shocking news of the aid workers\u2019 deaths, much of the humanitarian consignment that had reached Gaza via the maritime corridor from Cyprus is now being returned to the island, we have learned. \n  \u201cAt least two-thirds of the assistance is on its way back,\u201d Cyprus\u2019s foreign minister spokesperson, Theodoros Gotsis, told the Guardian.  \n  \u201cAround 332 tonnes of aid left Cyprus on Saturday. Around 100 tonnes, about a third, were unloaded and delivered but after these tragic events the other two-thirds are being brought back.\u201d \n  The aid, which had included basic non-perishable food supplies such as flour and pasta, had reached the besieged coastal strip on a flotilla of ships that had departed the Cypriot port of Larnaca two days earlier.  \n  Of the four vessels that had plied the route, two were carrying vital food provisions and two equipment and personnel. The humanitarian assistance had been loaded on a transport ship, the Jennifer, and a barge towed by the Spanish-flagged Open Arms. \n  By the time Monday\u2019s airstrike occurred, in which seven aid workers with World Central Kitchen died, only supplies from the barge had been offloaded at a makeshift jetty off the Gaza coast. \n  Gotsis said with the charity putting its humanitarian relief operation on pause, the cargo would probably remain in Cyprus until the completion of investigations into the tragedy. \u201cObviously we will have to wait now until the whole process of inquiry is carried out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to wait and see if WCK resumes operations.\u201d \n  The International organisation is now the only charity involved in overseeing the distribution of aid from the Mediterranean island.  \n  With famine reportedly spreading at an alarming pace among Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million strong Palestinian populace, the news of much-needed food being sent back from the territory has only exacerbated the unfolding tragedy in the enclave. \n  \n \n \n  2.08pm BST  \n Warsaw demands 'explanations' from Israel as Polish aid worker killed in Israeli airstrike is named \n  \n  Poland\u2019s foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, said he has demanded \u201curgent explanations\u201d from Israel\u2019s ambassador in Warsaw after an Israeli strike killed a Polish volunteer and six other aid workers in Gaza. \n  The president of the city of Przemysl, in southeastern Poland, earlier identified the volunteer as Damian Sobol. \n  \u201cI personally asked the Israeli ambassador Yacov Livne for urgent explanations,\u201d Sikorski said on social media, adding that he had offered \u201ccondolences to the family of our brave volunteer\u201d. \n  He also announced Poland had opened its own inquiry into the aid worker\u2019s death. \n   \n   \n    Sk\u0142adam najszczersze kondolencje rodzinie naszego rodaka, Pana Damiana.

It said it was immediately \u201cpausing\u201d its operations in the region. \n   An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said it was \u201cconducting a thorough review at the highest levels to understand the circumstances of this tragic incident\u201d. \n   Footage showed the bodies of five of the WCK workers at Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah. Several of them wore protective body armour with the charity\u2019s logo. \n   Medical officials said the group had been helping to deliver food and other supplies to northern Gaza that had arrived hours early by ship. \n   Australia\u2019s prime minister said the death of an Australian aid worker among those killed was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and the government demanded \u201cfull accountability\u201d.

Sullivan would consult broadly on a number of matters, a second US official said, adding: \n   \n   He has not been to Saudi Arabia in some time and there\u2019s lots to discuss. \n   \n  The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said almost two weeks ago that the US and Saudi Arabia had made \u201cgood progress\u201d in talks on normalising ties between the kingdom and Israel, without providing a timeline for concluding a deal. \n  As part of a normalisation deal, Saudi Arabia wants to secure a mutual defence pact with Washington and get US support for its civil nuclear program. \n  \n Updated at 6.59am BST \n \n \n  6.28am BST  \n World Central Kitchen halts operations in region \n  \n  The charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) also says it is immediately \u201cpausing\u201d its operations in the region. \n  \u201cWe will be making decisions about the future of our work soon,\u201d the not-for-profit said in a statement on its website. \n  Its CEO, Erin Gore, said: \n   \n   I am heartbroken and appalled that we \u2013 World Central Kitchen and the world \u2013 lost beautiful lives today because of a targeted attack by the IDF.  \n   The love they had for feeding people, the determination they embodied to show that humanity rises above all, and the impact they made in countless lives will forever be remembered and cherished. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.02am BST \n \n \n  6.22am BST  \n Seven killed in Gaza strike, food charity says \n  \n  World Central Kitchen says seven of its team members were killed in what it called an Israeli military strike in Gaza. \n  The toll updates an earlier number of five. \n  The food charity said in a statement on its website that the seven killed were from Australia, Poland, the UK, a dual citizen of the US and Canada, and Palestine. \n  World Central Kitchen\u2019s chief executive, Erin Gore, said its team was \u201ctravelling in a deconflicted zone in two armored cars branded with the WCK logo and a soft skin vehicle\u201d. \n   \n   Despite coordinating movements with the IDF [Israel Defence Forces], the convoy was hit as it was leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, where the team had unloaded more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza on the maritime route. \n   \n  Gore also said: \n   \n   This is not only an attack against WCK, this is an attack on humanitarian organisations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of war. This is unforgivable. \n   \n  The Israeli Defence Forces said it was conducting a \u201cthorough review\u201d into what occurred. \n  \n Updated at 7.01am BST \n \n \n  6.04am BST  \n  \n  The grieving family of Zomi Frankcom, the Australian aid worker killed by an apparent Israeli military airstrike in Gaza, has said she died \u201cdoing the work she loves\u201d. \n  \u201cWe are deeply mourning the news that our brave and beloved Zomi has been killed doing the work she loves, delivering food to the people of Gaza,\u201d her family said in a statement. \n   \n   She will leave behind a legacy of compassion, bravery and love for all those in her orbit. \n   \n  The Melbourne-born 43-year-old \u201cwas a kind, selfless and outstanding human being [who] travelled the world helping others in their time of need\u201d, her family said. \n  Frankcom and four other international and Palestinian colleagues were killed in the alleged Israeli airstrike fired on their convoy south of Deir al-Balah late on Monday. \n  \n Updated at 7.41am BST \n \n \n  5.52am BST  \n  \n  The White House national security council said the US was \u201cheartbroken and deeply troubled\u201d by the death of the aid workers in Gaza. \n  Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson went on to say the White House urged Israel to \u201cswiftly investigate what happened\u201d. \n   \n   \n    We are heartbroken and deeply troubled by the strike that that killed @WCKitchen aid workers in Gaza.

The Israeli military was involved in coordinating both deliveries. \n  The US has touted the sea route as a new way to deliver desperately needed aid to northern Gaza, where the UN has said much of the population is on the brink of starvation, largely cut off from the rest of the territory by Israeli forces. \n  Israel has barred Unrwa, the main UN agency in Gaza, from making deliveries to the north, and other aid groups say sending truck convoys north has been too dangerous because of the military\u2019s failure to ensure safe passage. \n  \n Updated at 5.50am BST \n \n \n  5.22am BST  \n  \n  Tributes have been paid to Zomi Frankcom, the Australian aid worker killed in Gaza. \n  Karuna Bajracharya posted on Facebook: \n   \n   Rest in peace our beautiful sister. \n   Zomi risked her life many times to help those in dire need, yet our cowardly politicians don\u2019t even dare to risk their own careers by speaking up against Israel and the USA\u2019s six months of genocide! \n   \n  Frankcom had worked with the World Central Kitchen charity for five years, having been previously based in Bangkok and the US. She had formerly worked at Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Bank for more than eight years. \n  Tim Costello, a former World Vision chief, paid tribute to aid workers who risked their lives in conflict zones: \n   \n   It\u2019s a special type of person who actually says: \u2018I\u2019m going to serve others in this way, I\u2019m going to risk my own life to actually protect the innocent\u2019. \n   \n  Costello described the deaths of aid workers as a \u201cbridge that we have crossed\u201d. \n   \n   We know [foreign aid] is inherently risky \u2026 we know that aid workers take risks. They don\u2019t take rifles, they don\u2019t take tanks. All they have is a logo, and a flag, and the confidence that the international system respects humanitarian workers. \n   That\u2019s why this is utterly, utterly devastating. \n   \n  The full story from Ben Doherty is here: \n   \n    Related: Australian aid worker killed by IDF strike in Gaza named as Zomi Frankcom  \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.26am BST \n \n \n  4.58am BST  \n  \n  In late March, Zomi Frankcom, the Australian aid worker killed in the strike in Gaza, appeared in a video filmed at Deir al-Balah talking about the meals being prepared for Palestinians by World Central Kitchen. \n  A week later, Frankcom, along with her international and Palestinian colleagues, would die in that same besieged neighbourhood of central Gaza. \n   \n   \n    WCK\u2019s Zomi &amp; Chef Oli are in our new Deir al-Balah kitchen where our team is cooking thousands of portions of rice with beef &amp; vegetable stew today.

The potential operation against the militant group in the city has exposed one of the deepest rifts between Israel and its closest ally, funder and arms supplier. The US has already openly said Israel must do more to allow food and other goods through its blockade of Gaza to avert famine.\u201cThey agreed that they share the objective to see Hamas defeated in Rafah,\u201d the US and Israeli teams, known as the strategic consultative group (SCG), said in a joint statement released by the White House. \n  The US side expressed its concerns with various courses of action in Rafah. The Israeli side agreed to take these concerns into account and to have follow-up discussions between experts overseen by the SCG. Those discussions would include an in-person SCG meeting as early as next week.The virtual meeting came a week after planned in-person talks were nixed by Netanyahu when the US didn\u2019t veto a United Nations resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. \n  \n Updated at 5.28am BST \n \n \n  4.20am BST  \n  \n  Recapping other news, thousands of angry Israelis took to the streets on Monday for the third consecutive night to demand Benjamin Netanyahu quit as Israeli prime minister. \n  And, Agence France-Presse reports, the demonstrators say they are not going away. \n  Mass protests uniting families of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and an anti-government street movement that failed to unseat Netanyahu last year brought Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to a standstill on Saturday and Sunday. \n  As thousands again gathered in Tel Aviv and outside Israel\u2019s parliament in Jerusalem on Monday, several protesters told AFP that Netanyahu had to be forced out \u201cto save Israel\u201d. \n  \u201cThis is an existential crisis for Israel,\u201d said Einat Avni Levi, 40, whose family had to flee from the Nirim kibbutz a little over 2km (1.25 miles) from the border barrier with Gaza. \n  Referring to the around 250 hostages abducted by Hamas during the 7 October attack, she said: \n   \n   If someone comes and takes me from my bed, and I can\u2019t trust my army and my government to come and rescue me, I cannot live here. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.52am BST \n \n \n  4.03am BST  \n  \n  The Israeli strike on a central Gaza convoy on Monday came as, separately, Israeli forces withdrew from al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City after a two-week raid that left most of the major medical complex in ruins, as Lorenzo Tondo in Jerusalem reported. \n  Hamas claimed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) killed 400 people in the northern Gaza compound. \n  The report continues: \n  According to the IDF, the facility \u2013 Gaza City\u2019s main hospital before the war \u2013 was used to harbour Hamas fighters \u2026 \n  Palestinians who fled the facility described days of heavy fighting, mass arrests and forced marches past dead people, while the Hamas-run health ministry described the scale of the destruction inside the complex as \u201cvery large\u201d. \n  Footage showed widespread devastation, with the facility\u2019s main buildings reduced to burned-out husks. The hospital was now \u201ccompletely out of service\u201d, the ministry said. \n  Most of Gaza\u2019s hospitals are no longer functioning, the UN has said. \n  See the full story here: \n   \n    Related: Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza\u2019s al-Shifa hospital after two-week raid leaving facility in ruins  \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.16am BST \n \n \n  3.34am BST  \n  \n  We\u2019ve launched this video report on the Gaza strike, including footage of people being transported on stretchers as ambulances flash nearby. \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  3.18am BST  \n PM names Australian aid worker killed, demands 'full accountability' \n  \n  Australia\u2019s prime minister says the death of an Australian aid worker in Gaza is \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and \u201cbeyond any reasonable circumstances\u201d, saying the government will call in the Israeli ambassador and contact Israel\u2019s government. \n  Anthony Albanese says Australia\u2019s government is demanding \u201cfull accountability\u201d over the death. \n  Albanese named the aid worker as Zomi Frankcom, who was working with World Central Kitchen (WCK) in Gaza. At a press conference in Brisbane, Albanese said she was doing \u201cextraordinarily important work\u201d. \n  Four foreign nationals working for the food aid charity were killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza, according to health officials in the occupied territory. The founder of the WCK charity confirmed on Twitter that \u201cseveral\u201d staff members had died in an Israeli airstrike. \n  The Australian prime minister said: \n   \n   Those doing humanitarian work and civilians need to be provided with protection. Australia has had a very clear position of supporting a sustainable ceasefire ... Australians want to see an end to this conflict. \n   This news today is tragic. Dfat [the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade] have also requested a call-in from the Israeli ambassador as well.

The agency is the largest relief body operating in Gaza, which has been besieged by Israel since the attack. \n  Countries including Australia, Canada, Finland and Sweden have since restored funding to Unrwa, while several Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia have increased funding. \n  Japan is the sixth-biggest donor to the agency, according to the Unrwa\u2019s 2022 data.  \n  \n \n \n  2.32am BST  \n  \n  A correspondent for Agence France-Presse confirmed seeing five bodies with three foreign passports lying nearby at the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, the news agency reports. \n  Earlier, the Hamas-run territory\u2019s health ministry had said the bodies of four foreign aid workers and their Palestinian driver and translator were brought to the hospital after an Israeli strike targeted their vehicle. \n  The Israeli military said it was \u201cconducting a thorough review\u201d. \n  World Central Kitchen has been involved in delivering the aid arriving by boat from Cyprus, and in the construction of a temporary jetty in Gaza.  \n  Two charities have organised aid deliveries by sea from Cyprus, with the second flotilla, setting sail on Saturday with about 400 tonnes of supplies \u2013 a fraction of Gaza\u2019s needs. \n  Since Hamas\u2019s unprecedented 7 October attack, Gaza has been under a near-complete blockade, and UN agencies have warned repeatedly that northern Gaza is on the verge of famine. Israel has denied responsibility. \n  \n \n \n  2.09am BST  \n  \n  Australia\u2019s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has told national broadcaster the ABC that the country\u2019s foreign ministry is \u201curgently investigating\u201d reports of the strike on a Gaza convoy. \n  An Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said reports of the death of an Australian aid worker were very distressing. \n  \u201cWe have been clear on the need for civilian lives to be protected in this conflict,\u201d Reuters quoted the spokesperson as saying.  \n   \n   We have been very clear that we expect humanitarian workers in Gaza to have safe and unimpeded access to do their lifesaving work. \n   \n  \n \n \n  2.04am BST  \n World Central Kitchen founder 'heartbroken' at deaths \n  \n  Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s said he was \u201cheartbroken and grieving\u201d over the deaths in the strike. \n  The World Central Kitchen\u2019s founder said on X (formerly Twitter) that the WCK \u201clost several of our sisters and brothers in an IDF air strike in Gaza\u201d and that \u201cthey are not faceless \u2026 they are not nameless\u201d. \n  Andr\u00e9s added: \n   \n   The Israeli government needs to stop this indiscriminate killing.

Here\u2019s what we know so far: \n   \n   The Israeli military said it was investigating after nationals from UK, Australia and Poland who were working for the World Central Kitchen were reportedly in the convoy that was struck. \n   The nationality of a fourth aid worker was not immediately known. A Palestinian translator was also reportedly killed. \n   The group were travelling in a convoy that was hit south of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, local officials said. \n   The media office of the Hamas-run government of Gaza reported the deaths late on Monday. \n   Footage showed the bodies of the five dead at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah.

We do not accept any suggestion that this is just something that can be brushed aside as just something that happens in war.\u201d \nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, also stepped up his criticism on Thursday, calling Netanyahu\u2019s initial explanation \u201cnot good enough\u201d. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nIsrael is facing mounting international pressure over the incident, with Joe Biden telling Netanyahu in a phone call that future US support for the war in Gaza will depend on it taking concrete action to protect civilians and aid workers. \nThree vehicles, marked as belonging to the charity World Central Kitchen, were struck by Israeli drones on Monday when they travelled along a route south of Deir al-Balah pre-approved and coordinated with the Israel Defense Forces. \nIn an interview with Guardian Australia\u2019s Australian Politics podcast to be released on Saturday, Wong suggested the remarks amounted to an attempt to justify an action that was outside the rules of war. The podcast was recorded on Thursday. \n\u201cEven in war, there are rules and they include the principles of distinction between a military target and a civilian target,\u201d Wong said. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nShe also condemned the suggestion from an Israeli government spokesperson that darkness and confusion were also reasons for what Israel has called \u201ca grave mistake\u201d. \n\u201cWe do not accept that these events \u2013 this attack on an aid convoy \u2013 can be dismissed or lessened or diminished in any way at all,\u201d Wong said. \nThe foreign minister said both Israeli commanders and individual military personnel in the field had obligations under international and humanitarian law. \nWong emphasised that this was not the first Israeli attack on aid convoys, citing UN figures that 196 aid workers had been killed prior to the WCK incident. \nWong did not specifically endorse the Frankcom family\u2019s calls for a war crimes investigation, but also did not rule it out. She would not be drawn on possible future sanctions against Israel, but said consequences would be considered once the full facts were known. \n\u201cI think \u2018accountability\u2019 means we find out what happened and that whatever steps are necessary as a consequence are taken,\u201d Wong said. \nThe IDF said the findings of its investigation had been presented to the ambassadors of countries whose citizens were killed, and would be released to the public within 24 hours. \nGuardian Australia understands Australia has been briefed on Israel\u2019s investigation into the killing of WCK workers, but is still awaiting \u201ca full and transparent report\u201d. \nThe Australian government plans to engage with other affected countries to ensure they could all have confidence in the process and its outcomes. \nLt Col Peter Lerner, an IDF spokesperson, told ABC Radio National on Friday that the IDF liaison officer who had worked closely with WCK was \u201cdevastated from this because he was part of that coordination process\u201d. \nPressed to justify the claim that the investigation was independent, Lerner said this was because it was carried out by \u201cformer military professionals\u201d who were \u201cindependent of the chain of command\u201d. \n\u201cThey are not under the control of the IDF \u2026 they are not dependent on promotion or anything like that, they are completely independent of the system,\u201d Lerner said. \nAsked whether individual members of the IDF would be named and have action taken against them if they were found to be responsible for the attack, Lerner said: \u201cI don\u2019t know the outcome but if that is the situation I would expect nothing less.\u201d \nLerner echoed Netanyahu\u2019s initial remarks. \u201cThe nature of warfare is that it is always full of tragedies,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cSince the dawn of war, civilians have been caught up in warfare. We have to be better than that, we have to do better.\u201d \nLerner pushed back at a report in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz earlier this week that there was poor discipline among IDF field commanders. \n \n  Related: Food charity demands independent inquiry into Israeli killing of aid staff  \n \nThe newspaper quoted an Israeli intelligence source as saying that in Gaza \u201ceveryone does as he pleases\u201d and interprets the rules of engagement individually. \nLerner said \u201cgenerally\u201d that \u201cwe would expect that the rules are upheld to the highest standards\u201d. \n\u201cIf there is a breach of them, then they need to be dealt with by disciplinary and command level capabilities and perhaps even criminal [charges] if there\u2019s been a very dire mistake,\u201d Lerner said. \n\u201cAs a very broad observation I don\u2019t accept Haaretz\u2019s report, but it doesn\u2019t mean that there can\u2019t be mistakes or individual initiatives.\u201d \n \n Hear the full interview with Penny Wong on Guardian Australia\u2019s Australian Politics podcast on Saturday \n", "No progress made at Cairo ceasefire talks, says Hamas, as Israel pulls troops out of southern Gaza \u2013 as it happened [2024-04-08T13:55:03Z]": " \n  2.55pm BST  \n Closing summary \n  \n   \n   A Hamas official told Reuters on Monday that no progress was made at a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks in Cairo also attended by delegations from Israel, Qatar and the United States. \u201cThere is no progress yet,\u201d he added.

Al-Qahera cited a high-ranking Egyptian source to report that the progress was made on \u201cseveral contentious points of agreement\u201d. \n  The Qatari and Hamas delegations had left the Egyptian capital and were expected to return \u201cwithin two days to finalise the terms of the agreement\u201d, it reported. \n  US and Israeli delegations were due to leave the Egyptian capital \u201cin the next few hours\u201d and consultations were expected to continue over the next 48 hours, it added. \n  Meanwhile, Israel has pulled all of its ground troops out of southern Gaza for \u201ctactical reasons\u201d, the country\u2019s army has said, raising questions about the six-month-old war\u2019s future direction amid the Cairo talks. \n  The Israel military said a \u201csignificant force\u201d would continue to operate in the rest of Gaza. \n  The troop drawdown is believed to be primarily to relieve reservists after months of fighting in Khan Younis, rather than any significant shift in strategy. \n  The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said on Sunday evening that the withdrawal was part of preparations to launch a ground attack on Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah. \n  In other developments: \n   \n   CIA director Bill Burns and Qatari prime minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani will join the negotiators from Egypt, Israel and Hamas in Cairo, according to some media reports. An Israeli delegation will also take part in the talks, an Israeli official said. However, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, also said on Sunday that Israel would not agree to a ceasefire until the hostages being held in Gaza were released. \n   Three people were killed, including a field commander in Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah elite forces Al Radwan, in an Israeli strike on Al Sultanya village in southern Lebanon, two security sources told Reuters early on Monday. \n   None of Israel\u2019s embassies was safe any more, a senior adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader said. Tehran viewed confrontation with Israel as a \u201clegitimate and legal right\u201d, Yahya Rahim Safavi was quoted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency saying on Sunday. He was speaking after a suspected Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus on 1 April for which Tehran has vowed retaliation. \n   At least 33,175 Palestinian people have been killed and 75,886 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said. Thirty-eight were killed and 71 injured over the past 24 hours, the Hamas-run ministry said on Sunday. UN agencies and charities said the situation was \u201cbeyond catastrophic\u201d amid a looming famine. \n   Iraq has agreed to send 10m litres of fuel to the Gaza Strip in support of the Palestinian people, the prime minister said. Iraq also agreed to receive wounded Palestinians from Gaza and provide them treatment in government and private hospitals, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani added in a statement on Sunday. \n   The White House has pushed back on comments by World Central Kitchen founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s that Israel is engaged in \u201cwar against humanity itself\u201d following the Israeli attack that killed seven aid workers, but ruled out putting US monitors on the ground in Gaza. \u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be some changes to the way Israeli defence forces are prosecuting these operations in Gaza to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d the White House national security communications adviser, John Kirby, told the US ABC on Sunday. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.43am BST \n", "Middle East crisis: Israel withdraws from al-Shifa hospital in Gaza as Hamas-run media office says hundreds of Palestinians killed \u2013 as it happened [2024-04-01T14:50:31Z]": " \n  6.15pm BST  \n  \n  Israeli warplanes have destroyed the Iranian consulate in Damascus, killing several people including a senior commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). \n  Among those killed was Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), Iranian state media reported.

Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called off a planned visit to Washington last week by a senior Israeli delegation after the US allowed passage of a Gaza ceasefire resolution at the United Nations on Monday. Two days later Israel asked the White House to reschedule a high-level meeting on military plans for Gaza\u2019s southern city of Rafah, officials said, in an apparent bid to ease tensions between the two allies. An American official told the Associated Press that the US anticipates that \u201cexpert teams\u201d will follow up on the talks in person. \n   The Hamas-run Gaza media office said Israeli forces killed 400 Palestinians around al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, including a female doctor and her son, also a doctor, and put the medical facility out of function. \u201cThe occupation destroyed and burnt all buildings inside al-Shifa medical complex. They bulldozed the courtyards, burying dozens of bodies of martyrs in the rubble, turning the place into a mass graveyard,\u201d Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the media office, was quoted as saying by Reuters. \u201cThis is a crime against humanity.\u201d Israeli forces said earlier they had withdrawn from al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City after a two-week operation. Residents described scenes of \u201ctotal destruction\u201d at the site, saying Israeli troops had \u201cdestroyed all sense of life\u201d there. The Israeli military said it had killed and detained hundreds of gunmen in clashes in the area of the hospital, and seized weaponry and intelligence documents. \n   Benjamin Netanyahu revived moves to shut down Al Jazeera in Israel, saying through his party spokesperson that parliament would be convened in the evening to ratify the necessary law. Thereafter, Netanyahu \u201cwill take immediate action to shut down Al Jazeera in accordance with procedure set out in the law\u201d, the Likud party statement said. \n   Netanyahu will be discharged from hospital on Tuesday afternoon after a hernia procedure, a statement from his office said. Earlier, the Hadassah Medical Centre in Jerusalem said he was conscious and conversing with family, and that he was recovering. It did not specify how long that might take. \n   At least 32,845 Palestinians have been killed and 75,392 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement.

The ultra-Orthodox, meanwhile, say drafting them into the military would compromise their pious way of life. \n   They say they share the burden of service by praying and being observant Jews.

Footage circulated on social media \u2013 and not yet verified by the Guardian \u2013 showed the bodies of dead Palestinian people, some covered in dirty blankets, scattered on the ground. It showed the grounds heavily ploughed up, and numerous buildings outside the facility either flattened or burned down.

Demonstrators, including relatives of those being held captive in Gaza, criticised the failure to free the Israeli hostages and called for new elections. \n   Israeli police said on Monday they had arrested the sister of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh as part of an investigation in southern Israel.

Israeli officials have said that Rafah, located on the Egyptian border, is Hamas\u2019 last major stronghold in Gaza. An estimated 1.5 million Palestinians \u2013 over half of Gaza\u2019s population \u2013 have taken refuge in Rafah after fleeing Israeli bombardment elsewhere in the territory. Netanyahu has been warned that launching a ground invasion of the southern city would have devastating humanitarian consequences and would result in many more civilians being killed. The White House has said it will not support a Rafah operation without the Israelis presenting a credible plan to ensure the safety of Palestinian civilians. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.05pm BST \n \n \n  11.20am BST  \n  \n  In Wisconsin, in the US, a campaign by anti-war voters to abandon Joe Biden during the Democratic primary has found an ally in the labor movement \u2013 but not from its traditional leaders. \n  Instead, the Listen to Wisconsin campaign, an effort inspired by the Michigan campaign to reject Biden during the primary over his military support for Israel, has earned the support of rank-and-file trade unionists and a statewide coalition of low-wage workers and immigrants angry about the president\u2019s handling of the war. \n  \u201cIndividuals in labor have been very active,\u201d said Janan Najeeb, a Wisconsin organiser spearheading the Listen to Wisconsin campaign. \n  Israel\u2019s war on Gaza has laid bare a divide within the labor movement \u2013 which has played out largely between union leaders in the AFL-CIO, the largest US labor federation, and the movement\u2019s rank and file, many of whom have vocally opposed the war and turned to their unions as an avenue for political action. \n  You can read the full story by my colleague, Alice Herman, here: \n   \n    Related: Rank-and-file union members back campaign to ditch Biden over Gaza  \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.03am BST  \n  \n  Here is a video of the destruction left in the wake of the Israeli army\u2019s withdrawal from the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City:  \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  10.37am BST  \n  \n  \u201cDuring [the Israeli] siege inside al-Shifa hospital, we did not have the means to treat patients \u2026 We could not treat or bury them,\u201d a nurse with the hospital told Al Jazeera.  \n  \u201cThe smell of corpses filled the place,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat happened to us is indescribable.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  10.17am BST  \n  \n  Hundreds of residents have rushed to the area around the al-Shifa hospital to check on damage to the surrounding residential districts. \n  \u201cI haven\u2019t stopped crying since I arrived here, horrible massacres were committed by the occupation here,\u201d said Samir Basel, 43, speaking to Reuters via a chat app as he toured the hospital\u2019s grounds in Gaza City. \n  \u201cThe place is destroyed, buildings have been burnt and destroyed.

Egypt, Qatar and the US have mediated previous rounds of negotiations, but a workable agreement has remained elusive. \n   Israel\u2019s Red Sea port city of Eilat came under an aerial attack on Monday that caused no casualties, the military said, with an Iranian-backed armed group in Iraq issuing a claim of responsibility. The military\u2019s statement said a flying object launched from east of Israel had struck a building in Eilat. There was no interception by air defences, it said. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a militia, later said it had attacked a \u201cvital objective\u201d in Israel \u201cusing appropriate weapons\u201d. \n   Israel has given the UN a proposal to dismantle Unrwa, its relief agency in the Palestinian territories, and transfer its staff to a replacement agency to make large-scale food deliveries into Gaza, according to UN sources. The proposal was presented late last week by the Israeli chief of the general staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, to UN officials in Israel, who forwarded it to the organisation\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, on Saturday, sources familiar with the discussions said. \n   An Israeli airstrike hit a tent camp in the courtyard of a crowded hospital in central Gaza on Sunday, according to reports. An associated press reporter filmed the strike and aftermath at al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah, where thousands of people have sheltered. The Israeli military said it struck a command centre of the Islamic Jihad militant group and claimed the hospital\u2019s functioning was not affected. \u201cThe command centre and terrorists were struck precisely, intended on minimising harm to uninvolved civilians in the area of the hospital,\u201d the military said.  \n   The strike at al-Aqsa hospital was witnessed by a World Health Organization team sent there to assess needs and to collect incubators for the north of Gaza, WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a post on X. \u201cFour people were killed and 17 injured. WHO staff are all accounted for.\u201d He gave no details of the victims. Several journalists were reportedly injured in the strike. \n   Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has undergone a \u201csuccessful\u201d hernia surgery, according to a statement from his office. Netanyahu was \u201cin good shape and beginning to recover\u201d, AFP reports. Doctors discovered the hernia on Saturday and Netanyahu had the surgery after completing his daily schedule, his office said. \n   The United States and Israel are expected to hold a virtual meeting on Monday to discuss the Biden administration\u2019s alternative proposals to an Israeli military invasion of Rafah, Axios reported on Sunday citing three Israeli and US officials. \n   At least 32,782 Palestinians have been killed and 75,298 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement. \n   A bomb exploded in a shopping area in a northern Syrian city held by pro-Turkish forces on Sunday morning, killing eight people and injuring more than 20 others, a war monitor said.

The Australian government said on Friday that the information provided by Israel on its investigation into the killing of Australian citizen Zomi Frankcom and her World Central Kitchen colleagues \u201chasn\u2019t yet satisfied our expectations\u201d. The comments come after Australia received a briefing on the initial findings of Israel\u2019s investigation on Friday morning. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said later on Friday that it had dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others for their roles in drone strikes in Gaza that killed seven aid workers on a food-delivery mission, saying they had mishandled critical information and violated the army\u2019s rules of engagement.The findings of a retired general\u2019s investigation into the Monday killings marked an embarrassing admission by Israel, which faces growing accusations from key allies, including the US, of not doing enough to protect Gaza\u2019s civilians from its war with Hamas, AP reports.The findings are likely to renew scepticism over the Israeli military\u2019s decision-making. Palestinians, aid groups and human rights organisations have repeatedly accused Israeli forces of firing recklessly at civilians throughout the conflict \u2014 a charge Israel denies.   Related: Penny Wong says Netanyahu trying to \u2018brush aside\u2019 death of Zomi Frankcom \u2018deeply insensitive\u2019    The Australian foreign minister, Penny Wong, said official responses to the incident \u201csuggest the gravity of the death of seven humanitarian workers is yet to be appreciated by the Israeli government\u201d. \u201cAustralia is concerned by initial advice from the [Israeli] ministry for foreign affairs that those responsible for commissioning and implementing the operation that killed Ms Frankcom and her colleagues have not been stood down while the investigation is undertaken,\u201d Wong said in a statement on Friday, prior to the IDF announcement. Wong and the defence minister, Richard Marles, were expected to write to their Israeli counterparts to outline Australia\u2019s demands for the remainder of the investigation and its push for accountability of those found to be responsible. These demands include that all evidence is preserved. This comes after the charity WCK said it had \u201casked the Israeli government to immediately preserve all documents, communications, video and/or audio recordings, and any other materials potentially relevant to the 1 April strikes\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Three WCK vehicles were struck by Israeli drones on Monday when they travelled along a route south of Deir al-Balah pre-approved and coordinated with the IDF. Wong and Marles were also expected to tell their counterparts that any findings that IDF targeting policies and practices contributed to the fatal incident should trigger urgent adjustments and announced openly. The Australian government also plans to appoint a \u201cspecial adviser\u201d to help scrutinise the Israeli investigation. This person, who has yet to be named, would likely be an Australian figure with expertise in military matters and international humanitarian law. The adviser\u2019s role would be to ensure the investigation has been conducted in a manner consistent with the Australian government\u2019s expectations. Marles said the deaths \u201cwere utterly inexcusable and clear practical action is needed to ensure such a tragedy is never repeated\u201d. The IDF has described the strikes as \u201ca grave mistake\u201d that \u201cfollowed a misidentification\u201d. It said on Friday that the findings of its investigation had been presented to the ambassadors of countries whose citizens were killed. WCK said on Thursday it had asked the governments of Australia, Canada, the US, Poland and the UK \u201cto join us in demanding an independent, third-party investigation into these attacks\u201d. The charity said such an investigation should examine whether the attacks were carried out intentionally or otherwise violated international law. The deputy leader of the Australian Greens, Mehreen Faruqi, called for \u201can independent war crimes investigation into the deaths of Zomi and other aid workers, by an agency like the international criminal court\u201d. Israel is facing mounting international pressure over the incident, with Joe Biden telling Benjamin Netanyahu that future US support for Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza would depend on it taking concrete action to protect civilians and aid workers. The US president also called for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d in Gaza \u201cto stabilise and improve the humanitarian situation and protect innocent civilians\u201d, the White House said. Soon after the call, Netanyahu\u2019s office announced that Israel would open the Erez crossing in northern Gaza, arguing that increased aid was \u201cnecessary to ensure the continuation of the fighting and to achieve the goals of the war\u201d. The UN humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Jamie McGoldrick, said the WCK deaths were \u201cnot an isolated incident\u201d as \u201cat least 196 humanitarians had been killed in the OPT since October 2023\u201d.", "Middle East crisis: World Central Kitchen says only \u2018systemic change\u2019 can stop military failures as IDF sacks officers over aid worker deaths \u2013 as it happened [2024-04-05T13:57:32Z]": "  2.57pm BST    Summary of the day so far    Here are all the key developments in the Middle East crisis from the past few hours:  The Israeli military said Friday that it dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others for their roles in drone strikes in Gaza that killed seven aid workers on a food-delivery mission, saying they had mishandled critical information and violated the army\u2019s rules of engagement.

This is incomprehensible, and entirely avoidable. Nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people. The Israeli government has acknowledged mistakes. But the essential problem is not who made the mistakes, it is the military strategy and procedures in place that allow for those mistakes to multiply time and time again. Fixing those failures requires independent investigations and meaningful and measurable changes on the ground. 196 humanitarian workers have been killed and we want to know why each one of them was killed.

Reuters reports: For several weeks, the military has been investigating reports that some of the 1,200 Israelis and foreign victims of the attack were killed by friendly fire during the chaos, in which more than 250 people were abducted as hostages. It said an inquiry into the events around the kidnapping of Efrat Katz, a resident of Kibbutz Nir Oz, one of the communities targeted by the attack, examined a variety of video evidence and testimony of witnesses. It said the evidence showed that one of the helicopter gunships fired at a vehicle in which gunmen were travelling and which the evidence also suggested had hostages in it. It said in a statement:  As a result of the fire, most of the terrorists manning the vehicle were killed, and most likely, Efrat Katz ... was killed as well. The commander of the air force did not find fault in the operation by the helicopter crew, who operated in compliance with the orders in a complex reality of war  It said the investigation showed that the hostages could not be distinguished by existing surveillance systems.       1.48pm BST    Israeli military dismisses two officers over Gaza drone strikes    The Israeli military said Friday that it dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others for their roles in drone strikes in Gaza that killed seven aid workers on a food-delivery mission, saying they had mishandled critical information and violated the army\u2019s rules of engagement.

With pressure mounting on Israel to hold itself accountable, Hagari and other officials late Thursday shared with reporters the results of the investigation.The speed of the probe and the swift punishment of five senior officers were extremely unusual. Such investigations are often slow and in most cases end without charges being filed. Human rights activists have long complained that Israeli forces operate in a climate of impunity, an allegation the military rejects. The military\u2019s spokesman, Rear Adm.

AFP reports: The resolution - which passed with 28 of the council\u2019s 47 member states voting in favour, six opposed and 13 abstaining - marked the first time the United Nations\u2019 top rights body has taken a position on the bloodiest-ever war in the besieged Palestinian territory. Meirav Eilon Shahar, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN in Geneva, denounced the resolution as \u201ca stain for the Human Rights Council and for the UN as a whole\u201d. The strongly worded text called on countries to \u201ccease the sale, transfer and diversion of arms, munitions and other military equipment to Israel... to prevent further violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights\u201d. It noted that the International Court of Justice ruled in January \u201cthat there is a plausible risk of genocide\u201d in Gaza. Friday\u2019s resolution, which was brought forward by Pakistan on behalf of all Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states except Albania, also called for \u201can immediate ceasefire\u201d and \u201cfor immediate emergency humanitarian access and assistance\u201d. The United States, Israel\u2019s key ally, heeded its call to vote no, as did Germany, Argentina, Bulgaria, Malawi and Paraguay. US ambassador Michele Taylor nonetheless voiced unusually strong criticism of Israel, saying it \u201chas not done enough to mitigate civilian harm\u201d. But she said Washington could not support the text because of its \u201cmany problematic elements\u201d, including failing to specifically condemn Hamas and its 7 October attacks. While the rights council resolution did not name Hamas, it did condemn the firing of rockets at Israeli civilian areas and demanded \u201cthe immediate release of all remaining hostages\u201d. But the main focus was on Israel, with the text demanding that it end its occupation of all Palestinian territories, lift its blockade of Gaza, and end \u201call other forms of collective punishment\u201d. The text also expressed \u201cgrave concern at statements by Israeli officials amounting to incitement to genocide\u201d and urged countries to \u201cprevent the continued forcible transfer of Palestinians within and from Gaza\u201d. It warned in particular \u201cagainst any large-scale military operations in the city of Rafah\u201d in the south of the densely populated Gaza Strip, where well over one million civilians are sheltering. The resolution also condemned \u201cthe use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in Gaza\u201d, where the UN has warned that famine is looming. Two other resolutions targeting Israel also overwhelmingly passed at the rights council Friday. One demanded a halt to Israeli settlements, calling on countries to do more to counter settler violence against Palestinians, including through sanctions, and on businesses to terminate activities in or with the settlements. The other deplored Israel\u2019s occupation of the Syrian Golan Heights and its \u201csettlement policies and practices\u201d there, in violation of the rights of Syrian inhabitants.       12.58pm BST       Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, has become the latest senior party figure to urge an immediate ban on UK arms sales to Israel, as ministers face pressure to disclose the government\u2019s official legal advice on the trade.

Seven employees of the charity World Central Kitchen, including six international volunteers, were killed in multiple Israeli airstrikes on their three-car convoy in Gaza late Monday.\u201cWe welcome that steps that have been announced by Israel,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cThese are positive developments but the real test is results and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to see in the coming days and the coming weeks.\u201dAt the same time, he said the U.S. wanted to see a \u201cbetter system for de-confliction and coordination\u201d so that aid can be safely delivered and distributed inside Gaza.\u201cAll of these things are critical and that really needs to be measured by results,\u201d Blinken told reporters in the town of Leuven, outside Brussels, where he was meeting with U.S. and European trade and commerce officials.    Updated at 12.35pm BST     12.23pm BST    World Central Kitchen says without 'systemic change' there will be more military failures    The World Central Kitchen (WCK) on Friday said the IDF deployed deadly force without regard to its own protocols, chain of command and rules of engagement, and has called for an independent commission to investigate the killing of 7 aid workers. The Israeli military said that it has dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others for their roles in drone strikes in Gaza that killed seven aid workers on a food-delivery mission, saying they had mishandled critical information and violated the army\u2019s rules of engagement. \u201cWithout systemic change, there will be more military failures, more apologies and more grieving families,\u201d WCK said, calling the IDF\u2019s disciplinary action against those involved and accepting responsibility \u201cimportant steps forward\u201d. \u201cWe demand the creation of an independent commission to investigate the killings of our WCK colleagues. The IDF cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza.\u201d WCK said the IDF acknowledged the organisations\u2019 teams followed proper communications procedures, and said the IDF\u2019s video footage \u201cfails to show any cause to fire on our personnel convoy, which carried no weapons and posed no threat.\u201d    The investigation into Monday\u2019s killings found officers failed to read messages alerting troops that cars, not aid trucks, would carry workers from the charity away from the warehouse where aid was distributed. As a result, the cars that were targeted were misidentified as transporting militants. The army also faulted a major who identified the strike target and a colonel who approved the strike for acting with insufficient information. The army said the order was given after one of the passengers inside a car was identified as a gunman. The aid workers were three British citizens, a Polish citizen, an Australian and a Canadian American dual citizen. Their Palestinian driver also was killed. WCK founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s said:  It\u2019s not enough to simply try to avoid further humanitarian deaths, which have now approached close to 200. All civilians need to be protected, and all innocent people in Gaza need to be fed and safe. And all hostages must be released.

If we succeed, everybody is helped,\u201d the celebrity chef turned aid supremo said of his plan to use his non-profit World Central Kitchen (WCK) to help avert the looming humanitarian disaster. On display was the same irrepressible can-do spirit that had enabled the Spanish-born Andr\u00e9s, now a US citizen, to bring food relief to citizens stricken by natural disaster or war in numerous far-flung locations, from Haiti to Ukraine.         11.46am BST       The killing of the aid workers, all of whom worked for World Central Kitchen, were condemned by Israel\u2019s closest allies and renewed criticism of Israel\u2019s conduct in the nearly 6-month-old war with Hamas.The aid workers were three British citizens, a Polish citizen, an Australian and a Canadian American dual citizen. Their Palestinian driver also was killed. The investigation into Monday\u2019s killings found two major areas of wrongdoing.It faulted officers for failing to read messages alerting troops that cars, not aid trucks, would carry workers from the charity away from the warehouse where aid was distributed. As a result, the cars that were targeted were misidentified as transporting militants.The army also faulted a major who identified the strike target and a colonel who approved the strike for acting with insufficient information. The army said the order was given after one of the passengers inside a car was identified as a gunman. It said troops became suspicious because a gunman had been seen on the roof of one of the delivery trucks on the way to the warehouse. The army showed reporters footage of the gunman firing his weapon while riding atop one of the trucks.After the aid was dropped off at a warehouse, an officer believed he had spotted a gunman in one of the cars. The passenger, it turned out, was not carrying a weapon \u2013 the military said its possible he was just carrying a bag.The army said it initially hit one car. As people scrambled away into a second car, it hit that vehicle as well. It did the same thing when survivors scrambled into a third car. Army officials claimed that drone operators could not see that the cars were marked with the words \u201cWorld Central Kitchen\u201d because it was nighttime.The army could not say exactly where the communication about the convoy\u2019s plans had broken down.The army declined to answer questions about whether similar violations of rules of engagement have taken place during the war \u2013 in which Palestinians, aid workers and international rights groups have repeatedly accused the army of recklessly striking civilians.The investigation was headed by Yoav Har-Even, a retired general.The seven who were killed were distributing food that had been brought into Gaza through a newly established maritime corridor. World Central Kitchen said it had coordinated its movements with the military, and that the vehicles were marked with the organization\u2019s logo.\u201cIt was a direct attack on clearly marked vehicles whose movements were known by\u201d the Israeli military, Andr\u00e9s said on Wednesday.More than 220 humanitarian workers have been killed in the conflict, according to the U.N.\u201cLet\u2019s be very clear. This is tragic, but it is not an anomaly,\u201d Scott Paul, of the humanitarian group Oxfam, said Thursday in a briefing with other relief organizations before the results of Israel\u2019s investigation were released. \u201cThe killing of aid workers in Gaza has been systemic.\u201d    Updated at 11.47am BST     11.40am BST    Israel military sacks two senior officers over killing of aid workers and says strikes were a tragedy    The Israeli military said on Friday that it has dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others for their roles in drone strikes in Gaza that killed seven aid workers on a food-delivery mission, saying they had mishandled critical information and violated the army\u2019s rules of engagement.The findings of a retired general\u2019s investigation into the Monday killings marked an embarrassing admission by Israel, which faces growing accusations from key allies, including the US, of not doing enough to protect Gaza\u2019s civilians from its war with Hamas, AP reports.The findings are likely to renew scepticism over the Israeli military\u2019s decision-making. Palestinians, aid groups and human rights organisations have repeatedly accused Israeli forces of firing recklessly at civilians throughout the conflict \u2014 a charge Israel denies.\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy,\u201d the military\u2019s spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious event that we are responsible for and it shouldn\u2019t have happened and we will make sure that it won\u2019t happen again.\u201dWith pressure mounting on Israel to hold itself accountable, Hagari and other officials late Thursday shared with reporters the results of the military\u2019s uncommonly speedy and detailed investigation.It was unclear whether the punishments and the apology would calm an international outcry over the deaths of the World Central Kitchen workers or reassure international aid groups that it was safe to resume operations in Gaza, where nearly a third of the population is on the brink of starvation.According to what spokespeople said were the Israeli army\u2019s rules, targets must be visually identified as threats for multiple reasons before they can be hit. But the investigation determined that a colonel had authorized the series of deadly drone strikes on the convoy based on one major\u2019s observation \u2014 from grainy drone-camera footage \u2014 that someone in the convoy was armed. That observation turned out to be untrue, military officials said.The army said the colonel and the major were dismissed, while three other officers were reprimanded. It said the results of its investigation were turned over to the military\u2019s advocate general, who will decide whether the officers or anyone else involved in the killings should receive further punishment or be prosecuted.    Updated at 11.42am BST     11.33am BST       Turkish authorities, who have denounced Israel for its war against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, have arrested two people suspected of spying for Israeli intelligence, interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said on Friday. Since January, Turkish authorities have detained or arrested and charged dozens of people suspected of having ties to Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence agency, Reuters reports. Six people were charged last month. Turkish and Israeli leaders have traded public barbs since Israel\u2019s war with the Palestinian militant group Hamas began in October. Turkey has warned Israel of \u201cserious consequences\u201d if it tries to hunt down Hamas members living outside the Palestinian territories, including in Turkey. In a post on social media platform X, Yerlikaya said police had detained eight people believed to be collecting and selling information to Mossad about targeted individuals and companies in Turkey. Of those, two had been arrested and six released on parole, he said. \u201cWe will never allow espionage activities that are carried out within our country\u2019s borders against our people\u2019s national unity and solidarity. We are in pursuit,\u201d he said.A Turkish security official said the raids, carried out in Istanbul, targeted a Turkish private detective and his wife, who were believed to have been involved with Mossad from 2011-2020. The official said the detective had previously met Mossad members in Austria, Switzerland and Germany and used private communication channels to keep in touch with them. The detective \u201cearned significant income\u201d from this and formed a network of nine people, the official said. Members of the network had confessed and the detective and his wife had been arrested, the person added. There was no immediate comment from Israel. A Turkish court in January ordered the arrest of 15 people and the deportation of eight suspected of having links to Mossad and targeting Palestinians living in Turkey.       11.26am BST       Poland\u2019s deputy foreign minister said on Friday that the Israeli ambassador to Poland apologised after an Israeli air strike killed a Polish aid worker in Gaza this week.Israeli ambassador Yacov Livne would not be expelled from Poland, the deputy Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Andrzej Szejna said. On Friday a German foreign ministry spokesperson said attacks that killed seven food aid workers of the World Central Kitchen (WCK) charity group in Gaza \u201ccast a bad light on the conduct of the Israeli army\u201d.       11.14am BST    Summary    Welcome to our latest live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war and wider Middle East crisis. Here\u2019s a snapshot of all the key developments so far. Israel has approved the reopening of the Erez crossing into northern Gaza and the temporary use of Israel\u2019s Ashdod port to increase humanitarian aid supplies into Gaza, a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said early on Friday. It also approved expanded entry of aid from Jordan through the Kerem Shalom crossing. The US secretary of state Antony Blinken has welcomed the steps announced by Israel on humanitarian aid to Gaza, but said \u201cthe real test is results\u201d. In other developments:  Since 7 October, 33,091 Palestinians have been killed and 75,750 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza, according to the Gaza health ministry on Friday. It was not possible to independently verify the figures. The United Nations Human Rights Council on Friday adopted a resolution calling for Israel to be held accountable for possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Gaza Strip. Twenty-eight countries voted in favour, 13 abstained and six voted against the resolution. Iran held a funeral on Friday for seven officers killed in a suspected Israeli airstrike on the Iranian embassy compound in Syria this week, an unprecedented attack for which Tehran has vowed to take revenge.      The findings of an investigation into the aid worker killings may come in \u201cthe next few days\u201d, an Israeli spokesperson suggested to the BBC, after officials signalled earlier that it could take weeks. WCK has called for an \u201cindependent, third-party investigation\u201d into the Israeli strikes and asked Australia, Canada, Poland, the US and the UK \u2013 whose citizens were killed \u2013 to join them in demanding the inquiry. A fourth former supreme court justice has put his name to a letter warning the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, that the UK is breaching international law by continuing to arm Israel, as the number of legal experts signing the letter rose to more than 750. Lord Carnwath joins Lady Hale, who was president of the UK\u2019s highest court, and lords Sumption and Wilson in urging ministers to act to prevent the \u201cplausible risk\u201d of genocide in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also said it again attacked what it described as \u201cterrorist infrastructure\u201d in Lebanon. It identified launches \u201ccrossing from Lebanon toward the areas of Betzet and Shlomi in northern Israel\u201d and struck the sources of the fire, it said. As well, \u201cIDF fighter jets struck terrorist infrastructure in the areas of Yaroun, Aynata, and Maroun El Ras\u201d. US forces destroyed an anti-ship missile in a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen on Thursday, US central command said on Friday, adding there were no injuries or damage reported by US, coalition or commercial ships. Israeli media reported a step up in GPS jamming inside the country, believed to be a preparation for a potential attack from Iran, which has vowed revenge after an airstrike on its consulate in Damascus killed several senior military commanders. Former US president Donald Trump urged Israel in its war with Hamas to \u201cget it over with fast\u201d. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump said Israel was \u201cabsolutely losing the PR war\u201d and called for a swift resolution to the bloodshed. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to peace and stop killing people.\u201d A political row has developed in Israel over plans to allow members of Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox community, the Haredim, to be conscripted, ending a longstanding religious exemption from military service. Supporters of both sides of the argument are threatening to walk out of Netanyahu\u2019s wartime national coalition if they do not get their way.        11.01am BST       Here are the latest images coming across the wires from Gaza:             10.44am BST       It is devastating that it took six months and the killing of six western aid workers for a tipping point to be reached for Israel to change course over the supply of international humanitarian aid, the chair of the UK foreign affairs committee has said.   Related: Delay in reaching Gaza aid tipping point devastating, says senior Tory    Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Alicia Kearns said the government must suspend arms sales to Israel and claimed ministers were no longer saying that Israel was complying with international humanitarian law, merely that it had the capacity to do so. \u201cI believe we have no choice but to suspend arms sales and it is important that the public understands this is not a political decision as some people want to present it as,\u201d she said.       10.13am BST       Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, has said Israeli air strikes have turned southern Lebanon into a \u201cdevastated agricultural area\u201d. Israel and the Iranian-backed Lebanese armed group Hezbollah have been trading fire across Israel\u2019s northern border since war erupted in Gaza, with Hezbollah firing rockets and Israel launching air strikes and artillery shells. The Israeli strikes have burned tens of thousands of olive trees and torched farmland across southern Lebanon, hurting herders and farmers already suffering from a deep economic crisis that has made it even more important for Lebanon to produce its own food.    \u201cEight hundred hectares have been completely damaged, 340,000 heads of livestock have died, and about 75% of farmers have lost their final source of income,\u201d Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency quoted Mikati as saying. \u201cThis problem will extend to the coming years.\u201d Agriculture Minister Abbas Hajj Hassan sounded the alarm last month, saying the Israeli strikes were preventing farmers in villages and towns near the border reaching their fields, affecting up to 30% of Lebanon\u2019s agricultural output.       9.49am BST    UN rights body adopts resolution for Israel to be held accountable for possible war crimes in Gaza    The United Nations Human Rights Council on Friday adopted a resolution calling for Israel to be held accountable for possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Gaza Strip. Twenty-eight countries voted in favour, 13 abstained and six voted against the resolution.    #HRC55 | Draft resolution A/HRC/55/L.30 on the Human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the obligation to ensure accountability and justice was ADOPTED. pic.twitter.com/URttz9IFjv&mdash; United Nations Human Rights Council | #HRC55 (@UN_HRC) April 5, 2024     The resolution stressed \u201cthe need to ensure accountability for all violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in order to end impunity\u201d. It also expressed \u201cgrave concern at reports of serious human rights violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law, including of possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Occupied Palestinian Territory\u201d. Meirav Eilon Shahar, Israel\u2019s permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, accused the Council of having \u201clong abandoned the Israeli people and long defended Hamas\u201d. \u201cAccording to the resolution before you today, Israel has no right to protect its people, while Hamas has every right to murder and torture innocent Israelis,\u201d she said ahead of the vote. \u201cA vote \u2018Yes\u2019 is a vote for Hamas.\u201d The United States had pledged to vote against the resolution because it did not contain a specific condemnation of Hamas for the Oct. 7 attacks, nor \u201cany reference to the terrorist nature of those actions\u201d. It did, however, said that its ally Israel had not done enough to mitigate harm to civilians. \u201cThe United States has repeatedly urged Israel to de-conflict military operations against Hamas with humanitarian operations, in order to avoid civilian casualties and to ensure humanitarian actors can carry out their essential mission in safety,\u201d said Mich\u00e8le Taylor, U.S. permanent representative to the Council. \u201cThat has not happened and, in just six months, more humanitarians have been killed in this conflict than in any war of the modern era.\u201d The U.N. Human Rights Council, which meets several times a year, is the only intergovernmental body designed to protect human rights worldwide. It can increase scrutiny of countries\u2019 human rights records and authorise investigations.    Updated at 10.27am BST     9.28am BST    Real test to Isreal's plans to increase humanitarian flow to Gaza 'is results', Antony Blinken says    The US secretary of state Antony Blinken has welcomed the steps announced by Israel on humanitarian aid to Gaza, but said \u201cthe real test is results\u201d. The statements come after Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office has said his security cabinet has approved a series of steps to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, including the temporary reopening of a key crossing that was destroyed in the 7 October Hamas attack. The announcement was made hours after a warning from US president Joe Biden that future US support for Israel would depend on it taking concrete action to protect civilians and aid workers. Blinken also said the US will look at the number of trucks entering and getting around Gaza, and will also look at indictators of potential famine to see if they reverse, according to Reuters. \u201cThese are positive developments but the real test is results,\u201d Blinken said. Since 7 October, 33,091 Palestinians have been killed and 75,750 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza, according to the Gaza health ministry on Friday.    Updated at 11.09am BST     9.14am BST    UN Human Rights Council debating ban on arms sales to Israel    The UN Human Rights Council was on Friday debating whether to demand a halt in arms sales to Israel, whose war in Gaza has killed more than 33,000 people, mostly civilians. The draft text calls on countries to \u201ccease the sale, transfer and diversion of arms, munitions and other military equipment to Israel\u201d. This, it said, is needed among other things \u201cto prevent further violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights\u201d. It stresses that the International Court of Justice ruled in January \u201cthat there is a plausible risk of genocide\u201d in Gaza, AFP reports.    If the text is adopted, it would mark the first time that the United Nations\u2019 top rights body has taken a position on the bloodiest-ever war to beset the besieged Palestinian territory. Friday\u2019s draft resolution, which was brought forward by Pakistan on behalf of all Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states except Albania, calls for \u201can immediate ceasefire\u201d and \u201cfor immediate emergency humanitarian access and assistance\u201d. It comes after the UN Security Council in New York last week also finally passed a resolution calling for a ceasefire - thanks to an abstention from Washington, Israel\u2019s closest ally and largest arms supplier. The rights council draft resolution does not name Hamas but it does condemn the firing of rockets at Israeli civilian areas and demands \u201cthe immediate release of all remaining hostages\u201d. It demands that Israel end its occupation of all Palestinian territories and \u201cimmediately lift its blockade on the Gaza Strip and all other forms of collective punishment\u201d. The text, which was revised late on Thursday removing several references to genocide, continues to express \u201cgrave concern at statements by Israeli officials amounting to incitement to genocide\u201d. And it urges countries to \u201cprevent the continued forcible transfer of Palestinians within and from Gaza\u201d. It warns in particular \u201cagainst any large-scale military operations in the city of Rafah\u201d in the south of the densely populated Gaza Strip, where well over one million civilians are sheltering, warning of \u201cdevastating humanitarian consequences\u201d. The draft resolution also condemns \u201cthe use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in Gaza\u201d, where the UN has warned that famine is looming.    Updated at 9.51am BST     8.55am BST       Iran held a funeral on Friday for seven officers killed in a suspected Israeli airstrike on the Iranian embassy compound in Syria this week, an unprecedented attack for which Tehran has vowed to take revenge. The funeral coincided with the annual Quds (Jerusalem) Day, during which Iran stages large state-sponsored pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel rallies nationwide. State television showed demonstrators carrying pictures of those killed and banners with slogans such as \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d and \u201cDeath to America\u201d, Reuters reports. The leader of Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad, Ziad al-Nakhala, took part in the rally in Tehran, Iranian media reported.    Among those killed in Monday\u2019s airstrike on the Iranian embassy compound in the Syrian capital Damascus was one of Iran\u2019s top soldiers, Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander in the Revolutionary Guard (IRGC). It was the boldest, and deadliest, in a series of attacks that have killed Iranian officials in Syria since December. Iran vowed harsh retaliation, raising the spectre of a wider war and prompting the Israeli armed forces to suspend leave for all combat units on Thursday, a day after they said they were mobilising more troops for air defence units.    Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday his country would harm \u201cwhoever harms us or plans to harm us\u201d. The coffins of two of the killed officers were displayed in the capital, Tehran, to religious mourning chants. Some of those present waved the Palestinian flag. All seven officers were expected to be buried later on Friday. Iran\u2019s Jerusalem Day rallies are held annually on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan in support of Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state in territories captured by Israel in a 1967 war.       8.33am BST       Should the UK stop arming Israel? The killing of six international aid workers and their Palestinian driver this week has brought new scrutiny of Israel\u2019s conduct in its war in Gaza. Peter Beaumont and Patrick Wintour examine the growing backlash on Today in Focus.   Related: Should the UK stop arming Israel? \u2013 podcast    They had told the Israelis they were there. Travelling along a coastal road in Gaza, six aid workers \u2013 from the UK, Poland, Australia and Canada \u2013 and their Palestinian driver. They had just unloaded more than 100 tonnes of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza for the millions of people at risk of famine when suddenly a drone appeared above them and struck not once but three times. There were no survivors.\u2028As Peter Beaumont tells Michael Safi, the strikes on the team from the aid organisation World Central Kitchen have done what 33,000 Palestinians deaths apparently could not and outraged leaders in the UK and around the world. Israel says these strikes were an error, a tragedy, to be independently investigated.     People inspect the site where World Central Kitchen workers were killed in Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip. Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/AP    As the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, explains, the mood at the highest level in the UK has noticeably shifted. Now there is an open debate among senior figures in the legal profession and at the top of politics about whether Britain should continue to arm Israel. Polling of the public suggests more than half of people believe it should stop.    Updated at 8.35am BST     8.07am BST    Israel announces it will allow 'temporary' aid deliveries into northern Gaza    Israel announced on Friday that it would allow \u201ctemporary\u201d aid deliveries into famine-threatened northern Gaza, hours after the United States warned of a sharp shift in its policy over Israel\u2019s war against Hamas militants. In a tense, 30-minute phone call on Thursday, US President Joe Biden told prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that US policy on Israel was dependent on the protection of civilians and aid workers in Gaza, the first hint of possible conditions to Washington\u2019s military support. Just hours later, in the middle of the night in Jerusalem, Israel announced it would open more aid routes into the coastal Palestinian territory which Israel placed under siege at the start of the war nearly six months ago. \u201cIsrael will allow the temporary delivery of humanitarian aid\u201d through the Ashdod Port and the Erez land crossing, as well as increased deliveries from neighbouring Jordan at the Kerem Shalom crossing, Netanyahu\u2019s office said. The White House quickly welcomed the moves - saying they came \u201cat the president\u2019s request\u201d - and said they \u201cmust now be fully and rapidly implemented\u201d.

Nor did his assertion that \u201cthis happens in wartime\u201d.    S\u00e1nchez, who has been one of the most outspoken and persistent European critics of the way in which Israel has prosecuted its war in Gaza after the terrorist atrocities of 7 October, described the Israeli prime minister\u2019s \u201csupposed explanations\u201d as \u201ctotally unacceptable and insufficient\u201d. He added that Spain was waiting for a full and detailed account of the killings before deciding \u201cwhat action we\u2019ll take with regard to the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu\u201d. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s latest remarks \u2013 along with his announcement on Monday that Spain intends to recognise a Palestinian state by July \u2013 are a further example of how some of the more habitually taciturn members of the EU have found themselves compelled to speak up amid concerns that the bloc is failing to live up to its moral, political and humanitarian duties.

Wong\u2019s direct personal condemnation of Netanyahu comes as the Israeli military reveals it has completed its investigation into the incident and briefed ambassadors from the countries whose citizens died in the attack.   Related: Penny Wong says Netanyahu trying to \u2018brush aside\u2019 death of Zomi Frankcom \u2018deeply insensitive\u2019    \u201cI find that statement \u2026 frankly, for the family in particular, a pretty insensitive \u2013 deeply insensitive \u2013 thing to say,\u201d Wong said of the Israeli prime minister\u2019s initial response.       7.18am BST    Opening summary    Welcome to our latest live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war and wider Middle East crisis. Here\u2019s a snapshot of all the key developments. Israel has approved the reopening of the Erez crossing into northern Gaza and the temporary use of Israel\u2019s Ashdod port to increase humanitarian aid supplies into Gaza, a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said early on Friday. It also approved expanded entry of aid from Jordan through the Kerem Shalom crossing. The Israeli move was announced shortly after a warning to Benjamin Netanyahu from the US president, Joe Biden, and as international pressure mounts on Israel after it took responsibility for a strike that killed seven workers with the World Central Kitchen (WCK) food charity. In a tense call with Netanyahu on Thursday, Biden called for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d and made clear that US policy would be determined by Israel taking \u201cconcrete and measurable steps\u201d to address civilian harm and humanitarian suffering, according to the White House. Right after Israel\u2019s announcement, the White House welcomed the moves to \u201cincrease aid flow to Gaza\u201d and called for them to be \u201cfully and rapidly implemented\u201d. In other developments:  At least 33,037 Palestinians have been killed and 75,668 injured in the Israeli offensive on Gaza since 7 October, the territory\u2019s health ministry said. The Hamas-led ministry said on Thursday about 62 Palestinians were killed and 91 injured over the past 24 hours. It was not possible to independently verify the figures.      The findings of an investigation into the aid worker killings may come in \u201cthe next few days\u201d, an Israeli spokesperson suggested to the BBC, after officials signalled earlier that it could take weeks. WCK has called for an \u201cindependent, third-party investigation\u201d into the Israeli strikes and asked Australia, Canada, Poland, the US and the UK \u2013 whose citizens were killed \u2013 to join them in demanding the inquiry. A fourth former supreme court justice has put his name to a letter warning the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, that the UK is breaching international law by continuing to arm Israel, as the number of legal experts signing the letter rose to more than 750. Lord Carnwath joins Lady Hale, who was president of the UK\u2019s highest court, and lords Sumption and Wilson in urging ministers to act to prevent the \u201cplausible risk\u201d of genocide in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also said it again attacked what it described as \u201cterrorist infrastructure\u201d in Lebanon. It identified launches \u201ccrossing from Lebanon toward the areas of Betzet and Shlomi in northern Israel\u201d and struck the sources of the fire, it said. As well, \u201cIDF fighter jets struck terrorist infrastructure in the areas of Yaroun, Aynata, and Maroun El Ras\u201d. US forces destroyed an anti-ship missile in a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen on Thursday, US central command said on Friday, adding there were no injuries or damage reported by US, coalition or commercial ships. Israeli media reported a step up in GPS jamming inside the country, believed to be a preparation for a potential attack from Iran, which has vowed revenge after an airstrike on its consulate in Damascus killed several senior military commanders. Former US president Donald Trump urged Israel in its war with Hamas to \u201cget it over with fast\u201d. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump said Israel was \u201cabsolutely losing the PR war\u201d and called for a swift resolution to the bloodshed. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to peace and stop killing people.\u201d A political row has developed in Israel over plans to allow members of Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox community, the Haredim, to be conscripted, ending a longstanding religious exemption from military service. Supporters of both sides of the argument are threatening to walk out of Netanyahu\u2019s wartime national coalition if they do not get their way.

He said the charity workers from WCK \u201cwere actually the good guys\u201d and that made the fatal incident \u201call the more painful\u201d. \n\u201cI mean, obviously, we know that this isn\u2019t something that the IDF would do or the Israeli air force would do on purpose,\u201d Hyman said. \nHyman was pressed by the ABC\u2019s Sally Sara to explain why the IDF had struck the vehicles \u201cwhen you had clear and direct information about the vehicles, their path and who was inside those vehicles, that these were aid workers\u201d. \n\u201cIt appears have been a grave, regrettable mistake, and we will do our utmost to look into it, to find out exactly what happened, and make sure that nothing like this happens again,\u201d Hyman replied. \nHyman said war was \u201chell\u201d and \u201cfoggy\u201d and Hamas had previously used ambulances and aid work \u201cas a cover for their activities\u201d. \n \n  Related: Albanese demands \u2018full accountability\u2019 for Zomi Frankcom\u2019s death as IDF calls strike a \u2018misidentification\u2019  \n \nAlbanese said on Thursday he \u201ccertainly\u201d agreed with the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, that Israel\u2019s explanations were insufficient and unacceptable. \nThe Australian prime minister hit back at the assertion by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that \u201cthis happens in wartime\u201d. \n\u201cWhat isn\u2019t good enough is the statements that have been made, including that this is \u2018just a product of war\u2019.

The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said it was not good enough to describe the killings of the aid workers as \u201cjust a product of war\u201d. He previously labelled the explanations of the deaths given by Israel as \u201cinsufficient and unacceptable\u201d. Wong said since Hamas\u2019s 7 October attacks on Israel the Australian government had urged Israel to observe international humanitarian law. However, she told reporters on Saturday that \u201cdemonstrably that did not occur in relation to Zomi Frankcom and her World Central Kitchen colleagues.\u201d \u201cWe again say we have a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Humanitarian assistance at scale must be enabled and it is clear that to date \u2013 prior to this it has not been. Civilians, including humanitarian workers, must be protected.

The agency urged the NT Government to immediately investigate alternative accommodation options for children currently detained in the Darwin facility, of which it alleged approximately half were being held on remand having not been sentenced for any crimes. Its principal legal officer, Jared Sharp, said the events were a \u201cdirect result of the appalling conditions within Don Dale\u201d.  On any given night, there are approximately 40 mostly Aboriginal young people detained inside Don Dale with little access to the support they need to address the complex array of factors that have contributed to them being there in the first place.  Sharp said Don Dale should have been closed on the recommendation of the Royal Commission more than six years ago, with recent redevelopment of youth detention facilities in Alice Springs providing a potential template for improved care.  The Northern Territory spends more on youth detention than any other state or territory and the only way to stop this is by investing in solutions that do work \u2013 drug and alcohol counselling, behaviour change programs, adequate healthcare, stable housing, education, training, and employment.        6.46am BST       More on the heavy rain and flood warnings in NSWIn New South Wales, a trough is forecast to deepen over eastern and central parts of the coast in coming days, bringing heavy rain and possible flash flooding for large parts of the state into the weekend.

Now, the systemic destruction of an entire people, the deliberate withholding of food and aid to an entire people are not acts of war.

Aly expressed her condolences to Frankcom\u2019s family and friends \u2013 and her \u201coutrage\u201d at Israel\u2019s response.  The dismissive way in which the prime minister of Israel has said this happens in war, and quite frankly the way in which Simon Birmingham has repeated that dismissive claim is offensive. It is offensive to Zomi, her family, to the aid workers, the journalists, the medics who have been killed by Israeli forces, and it is offensive to the 30,000 Palestinians that have been cowed and starved by the actions of Israel. I think that the world is watching very closely, and foreign minister Penny Wong has said, in very clear terms, that Israel needs to change its course, and that it needs to be held accountable, and that it is losing very quickly any kind of support that it has.     Updated at 7.26am BST     6.27am BST       \u2018This is a war situation and tragedies are occurring all the time\u2019: Birmingham The shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, appeared on the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing earlier while on a visit to New Zealand with Peter Dutton. Asked whether the deaths of the aid workers in Gaza could be \u201ceven partly explained as typical things that happen in war\u201d, Birmingham said the killings were \u201cvery tragic events\u201d that \u201cshould not have occurred\u201d.  It entirely appropriate that Israel be expected to have a full investigation of them and to be completely transparent about the outcomes of the investigation \u2026 any further steps should be taken based on the outcomes of those investigation.  Birmingham said while \u201ctragedies\u201d and \u201cmistakes\u201d do happen in war, it was important for Israel\u2019s prime minister to understand the \u201cdeep, deep concern and distress felt in Australia\u201d.  These tragedies are just part of what has been an enduring tragedy since the barbaric attacks from Hamas on October 7 and the way in which Hamas has used the citizens and people in Gaza as human shields. This is a war situation and tragedies are occurring all the time. Unfortunately this has now involved an Australian citizen.

Police were called to the centre on Wednesday afternoon after reports of smoke billowing from the education facility and 14 children on the roof of the building. Territory Families chief executive Emma White said the centre would remain in indefinite lockdown until a department investigation was complete. The NT chief minister Eva Lawler labelled the children \u201csome of the worst-behaved children in the NT\u201d, with charges expected to be laid.  There are a number of young people who have displayed abhorrent behaviour. There will be actions that flow from that.  Graphic footage was shown on ABC TV in 2016 of four detainees being tear-gassed at the facility, leading to the 2017 royal commission into the protection and detention of children. The NT government accepted in full or in principle all recommendations, including the closure of Don Dale. Five years later, the facility remains open and critics say the government is dragging its feet. Lawler said she remains committed to closing the facility. \u2013 with AAP    Updated at 6.31am BST     5.44am BST       Sixteen-year-old international student missing in Sydney Police are appealing to the public to help locate an international student from China who has been missing in north-west Sydney since Sunday. Jaiwen Zheng, aged 16, was last seen leaving a home on Beecroft Road, Beecroft on Sunday 24 February. When he did not return home and was unable to be contacted, he was reported missing to officers, who hold serious concerns for his welfare due to his age and limited English-language skills.

Updated at 5.39am BST     5.19am BST    Electric scooters 'here to stay' in Melbourne    Private and rental electric scooters will become a permanent fixture on Melbourne streets as Victoria puts the finishing touches on safety regulations. E-scooters were allowed in Ballarat from December 2021 and parts of Melbourne from February 2022 as part of a trial, with users since taking more than eight million trips. The trial will be extended for another six months before permanent regulatory settings are introduced in early October. The Victorian Labor government said it would use the time to investigate extra safety measures and rollout a refreshed education campaign across trial areas. Public transport minister Gabrielle Williams said e-scooters were \u201chere to stay\u201d.  They\u2019ve proven popular among commuters, especially shift workers, providing an additional option to travel home safely. We have more work to do on safety and compliance to ensure that e-scooters are safe when they\u2019re made permanent later this year.  In December, the Australian Medical Association called for stricter rules after a study by the Royal Melbourne Hospital showed 247 riders and nine pedestrians were treated for injuries in 2023. In Victoria, people must wear a helmet, be at least 16 years old, not carry a passenger and cannot be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. - via AAP      Updated at 5.34am BST     5.07am BST    Sydney braces for heavy rain and possible flooding    Sydney is bracing for heavy rain to drench the city over the coming days, potentially causing flash flooding, flooded rivers and the spillover of the Warragamba Dam. Rain is forecast to likely begin tonight in Sydney and become heavy on Friday before easing on Saturday. Up to 200mm of rain could fall across greater Sydney in that time. The intense rainfall may lead to flash flooding in the southern Hunter and Sydney metropolitan region on Friday morning as well as the Illawarra and Central Tablelands, before shifting south overnight into Saturday morning. BoM said \u201cdangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is possible between the Blue Mountains and Moruya from Friday evening into Saturday morning, with localised six-hourly rainfall totals between 90 to 150 mm possible, reaching up to 220 mm over the Illawarra Escarpment\u201d. Warragamba Dam, which supplies water to the city, could spill in the coming days if rainfall reaches the high levels expected. The dam is already at 96% capacity. Multiple rivers throughout Sydney could flood from Friday and the New South Wales SES has warned communities near the rivers to stay informed.The Hawkesbury-Nepean river in the city\u2019s west is at risk of major flooding from Friday, while the Colo River in the north-west is at risk of moderate flooding, the Bureau of Meteorology said. The Penrith, Liverpool and Camden areas are among those that could be affected.The Georges and Woronora rivers in the city\u2019s south and the Cooks River in the inner west may also flood from Friday.

The Greens\u2019 deputy leader, Mehreen Faruqi, said in a statement this afternoon the attack was \u201cpart of Israel\u2019s deliberate and sustained undermining of aid agencies in Gaza\u201d. She pointed to Israel\u2019s attempts to dismantle Unrwa, the United Nations\u2019 relief agency in Gaza, saying \u201ca phone call simply isn\u2019t good enough\u201d and that the Australian government \u201cmust respond with actions, not words\u201d. Faruqi said:  An investigation by Israel into the murders is totally unacceptable. We don\u2019t ask murderers to investigate their murders. Why would we ask war criminals to investigate their war crimes? The attack sent a stark message to the world that those who come to the aid of Gazans will not be spared, and it is having the intended chilling effect, with several aid agencies pausing operations in Gaza. It is clear, no one and nowhere is safe in Gaza. These attacks on aid agencies and aid workers are nothing less than an attempt by Israel to accelerate genocide and starve Palestinians of food and basic needs. The Labor government must increase funding to UNRWA, sanction Israel, end military exports to Israel and call for an independent war crimes investigation into the deaths of Zomi and other aid workers, by an agency like the international criminal court.

Its geographical size is on par with Mexico City (population 20 million), Paris (10.4 million) and Bangkok (14.6 million), but Sydney\u2019s population of 5.3 million pales in comparison. Now researchers have developed a model of how it spread out, likening the city\u2019s sprawl to how cancer spreads through a human body. Researchers used mathematical modelling to reconstruct urban growth in Sydney from 1851-2011. Along with finding that Sydney\u2019s population size and spread has evolved in a manner similar to a tumour, they also concluded the rail system has \u201ccoevolved\u201d with the urban population: that is, transport investment is not only demand driven \u2013 it also causes urban change.

The commission\u2019s latest figures, released on Thursday, show the federal integrity body received 2,747 referrals of potential corruption in the nine months since it opened its doors. Of those referrals, 2084 were dismissed because they did not involve a public official nor raise a corruption issue. There are 209 referrals under assessment by the Nacc, including 19 under preliminary investigation where further information and details have been sought. In total, the Nacc is investigating 15 corruption referrals and overseeing or monitoring 23 investigations by other agencies. Just who or what these investigations are looking into remains unknown due to the body\u2019s secrecy provisions, including its default to hold closed-door hearings. The Nacc has reiterated countless times it does not comment on ongoing investigations because doing so \u201cmay compromise operational activities or unfairly impact reputations\u201d. It has so far completed one final report \u2013 which will be made public \u201cshortly\u201d \u2013 while another seven final reports are being prepared. Those investigations did not result in any charges being laid. A further three matters are being considered by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.    Updated at 4.40am BST     3.56am BST       Amnesty calls for Australian support of independent investigation into Zomi Frankcom\u2019s death  Amnesty International Australia has written to the prime minister in support of calls from killed aid worker Zomi Frankcom\u2019s family for an independent investigation into her death. In a statement released today, Amnesty said it is calling on the Australian government to:  \u2026 publicly support the International Criminal Court\u2019s ongoing investigation into crimes committed in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and for the Court to investigate the death of Zomi Frankcom and humanitarian aid workers killed by Israel.  The calls for \u201cfull accountability \u2026 are hollow words\u201d unless such an investigation is conducted by the ICC, which already has an open investigation into crimes committed in the Occupied Palestinian Territories since 2014, the statement continues. Amnesty International Australia\u2019s spokesperson Mohamed Duar said:  The UN reports that 196 humanitarian aid workers have been killed attempting to deliver aid to people in Gaza since the crisis began. There is no chance of an independent and credible investigation by the Israeli authorities that will lead to justice for Zomi Frankcom or any of the aid workers killed. An Israeli investigation into the death of Zomi Frankcom and her colleagues risks an outcome similar to that of the Israeli investigation into the killing of Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in 2022, which did not find anyone responsible for her death, and failed even to open a criminal investigation into her death. It\u2019s vital that the current Australian Government publicly supports the International Criminal Court\u2019s investigation in the occupied Palestinian Territories.

He told AAP that emergency services had been called to rescue people who had driven into flood waters in the same area.

A severe weather warning has been issued in Queensland for the central west, Marranoa and Warrego regions, with 91mm recorded at Old Tambo Road, north of Charleville, in six hours on Thursday morning. The Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s Angus Hines said more warnings could be issued as thunderstorms moved through much of the state\u2019s south:  The most vigorous activity is generally over that Marranoa and Warrego region but potentially a little bit later today that could move somewhere else. The primary threat is going to be heavy rainfall, much like it was last night; localised pockets of very heavy rainfall.     Updated at 3.08am BST     2.49am BST       Kieran Loveridge granted parole  The man whose unprovoked attack killed a teenager and helped trigger years-long lockout laws in Sydney has been granted parole and is set to be released from prison, AAP reports. The NSW State Parole Authority on Thursday determined it would release Kieran Loveridge on supervised parole no later than 25 April.Parole authority chair Geoffrey Bellew acknowledged there would always be some risk to community safety with the 30-year-old\u2019s release, but that was mitigated by several factors.They include his completion of a violent offenders program, his positive progress in custody, an agreed post-release plan and strict conditions upon his release. Bellew told the court:  A substantially greater risk is posed to community safety if the offender was released at a later time with a shorter period of released supervision or no supervision at all.  Loveridge killed Thomas Kelly, 18, during an alcohol-fuelled rampage through the inner-city entertainment precinct of Kings Cross in July 2012. Loveridge, who was also 18 at the time, punched Kelly in the face, knocking him to the ground, causing a severe brain injury when his head struck the ground. Bellew said Kelly \u201chad no reason to be on the lookout for trouble and was entirely unsuspecting of danger\u201d. Appearing via a video link, Thomas\u2019s parents Ralph and Kathy Kelly said they \u201ccontinue to grieve every day\u201d but supported Loveridge\u2019s release before the end of his sentence in order to \u201creintegrate him into lawful community life\u201d. Loveridge was initially jailed for seven years and two months after pleading guilty to manslaughter and the assaults of four other men on that same night. His sentence was increased following a prosecution appeal, after which he was handed a maximum term of 13 years and eight months with a non-parole period of 10 years and two months.

Updated at 2.47am BST     2.25am BST       Household spending growth accelerates but discretionary outlays get a trim If dwelling approvals for February pointed a down arrow for the economy (see recent post), household spending was a bit more promising. Spending in February was up 3.6% from a year earlier, narrowly exceeding the 3.4% inflation rate recorded for the month, the ABS has just stated. Growth quickened from a dismal 1.2% pace in December and 2.9% in January. In a hint, though, to the ongoing cost-of-living squeeze, spending for so-called discretionary items was 0.2% lower than a year earlier. Non-discretionary outlays were up 6.9%. Among the states, spending in New South Wales and Victoria (which account for close to half the Australian economy) was notably weak. Discretionary spending in February was down 2.2% in NSW and 1.6% in Victoria \u2013 the only states to post a negative result. In terms of overall outlays, South Australia were the most spendthrift, up 7.9% from February 2023. ACT residents weren\u2019t far behind, forking out 7.6% more and Western Australia next in line with a 5.9% growth pace. As for what we\u2019re spending more on, transport was up 12.3% from a year earlier \u2013 thanks in part to more costly fuel. Recreation and culture outlays were up 5.9% with spending on hotels, cafes and restaurants rising 5.8%. Spending on services gained 5.1% from a year ago while food and goods expenditure was up 1.9% Lower interest rates might eventually buoy spending by those on variable mortgages but probably not until very late in 2024 on current market forecasts. (Tax cuts from 1 July should help before then.) Investors see very little chance of the Reserve Bank cutting the cash rate at its 6\u20137 May meeting and are only fully pricing in a rate cut by November, according to the ASX\u2019s rate tracker.

Unfortunately, there\u2019s little sign of a turnaround in dwelling approvals that economists and others have been looking for. Last month, Australia saw approvals for new dwellings reach 12,520, the ABS has just reported. That tally was down 1.9%, seasonally adjusted, from the previous month, and off 5.8% from a year earlier. Economists had been expecting a 3% month-on-month increase in February after several months of declines. Private house approvals did rise 10.7% in February, with a pickup in all states - including just over 20% in Western Australia. Unfortunately, that was countered by a drop in approvals for \u201clarge apartment projects\u201d, the ABS said. (We assume the retreat involved \u201clarge projects\u201d rather than projects of large apartments.) In value terms, the approvals involved $5.79bn worth of new residential buildings but that was down 19.1% (no mean feat given how much costs have been on the increase since the pandemic disrupted supplies and labour). The federal government has set a target of 1.2m new dwellings over five years, starting from the coming July. That would translate into 20,000 on average each month. At the current pace of approvals, there will have to be some serious ramping up of supply over those years if that goal is going to be reached, we noted in this article not so long ago:   Related: Australian housing approvals sink to lowest level in 12 years amid rising costs and planning delays      Updated at 2.01am BST     1.45am BST       Large increases in mercury and particulate pollution recorded at Eraring power plant Mercury and particulate pollution from Australia\u2019s largest coal-fired power station soared last year, prompting an environmental group to argue it would be \u201cabsurd and harmful\u201d for the New South Wales government to extend its operations. Origin Energy\u2019s 2,880-megawatt Eraring power station, slated by the company to close in August 2025, reported mercury pollution jumped 130% in 2022-23 compared with the previous year, according to data from the national pollution inventory. The heavy metal permanently damages brains and kidneys, especially those of children.    The plant, near Lake Macquarie, also reported an 88% increase in PM2.5 particle (particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less) pollution. Emissions of PM10 particles (particles with a diameter of 10 micrometres or less) emitted by Eraring also rose 16%, while sulfur-dioxide pollution rose 15%. Two other NSW power stations also reported large increases of toxic pollutants.

His comments suggest the party will target renters, first home buyers and supporters of the plight of Palestinians in the looming contest against Labor\u2019s Peter Khalil, who currently holds the seat by a comfortable 8.6% margin. Bandt said:  Peter Khalil and Labor have failed renters, failed people who are trying to buy their first home, and failed to condemn the State of Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza. The people of Wills are progressive and compassionate, but their values are being betrayed by a Labor party approving new coal and gas projects and backing the invasion of Gaza, while ignoring renters and offering band-aid solutions to the cost of living crisis. The people of Wills can send Labor a message without helping Peter Dutton.  He said only one in 10 voters needed to change their vote to the Greens for the party to win the seat, \u201cmake history and elect one of the most powerful MPs in the country\u201d:  Almost 40% of households in Wills are renting, but under Labor it\u2019s almost impossible to find an affordable rental or buy your first home because Labor backs unlimited rent increases while giving billions in tax handouts to wealthy property investors.

(Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Tuesday it was \u201ca tragic incident of an unintended strike\u201d but that \u201cthis happens in wartime\u201d). Albanese says:  Zomi Frankcom was travelling in a vehicle that was clearly identified as an aid vehicle. It should not have been at risk, and we need accountability for how this occurred and for people to be held to account for this. \u2026 The Israeli defence force have accepted their responsibility for this tragic event. We need to have accountability for how it has occurred, and what isn\u2019t good enough is the statements that have been made, including that this is just a product of war. This is against humanitarian law \u2013 international humanitarian law makes it very clear that aid workers should be able to provide that aid and that assistance free of the threat of losing their life.

He is asked if he would back an investigation specifically into whether those responsible for Zomi Frankcom\u2019s death should be charged with war crimes. His comments reflect those we reported earlier, but here they are in full:  What I have said is there needs to be full accountability and transparency for this tragic event \u2026 Zomi Frankcom was going about her business, helping humanity, and her being killed in this way is a catastrophic event that is devastating for her family, but is also felt keenly by our nation. I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday morning. I have demanded full accountability for what has occurred. They have committed to a full and proper investigation. I want that to be transparent and I want those findings to be made public so that we find out how exactly this can occur. What we know is there had been too many innocent lives lost in Gaza. What we know is that the impact of this war is such that it should not be the case that innocent Palestinians or people assisting them are made to pay the price for the actions of the terrorist group Hamas. I feel very strongly about this. Australia has called for a humanitarian ceasefire, we have voted that way at the United Nations, I have issued multiple statements with the prime minister of Canada and New Zealand as well as with Asean leaders. From the very beginning we have said every innocent life matters, whether it is Palestinian or Israeli, and now we\u2019ve seen an innocent Australian assisting her fellow humanity (sic) lose her life and this tragedy.

Tracks, trails, campgrounds, huts, picnic areas and accommodation in the affected areas of the park have been closed on Thursday and will remain so until October, the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service said. The agency said on its website:  The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service will be conducting aerial shooting operations in Kosciuszko national park. Horses, deer, pigs and other feral animals will be targeted.  Major ski resorts and other popular tourist areas will be unaffected by the changes. NSW has a legislated target to reduce the number of brumbies in the park to 3,000 by mid-2027 \u2013 from an estimated population of more than 22,000 \u2013 announcing in October that the state would return to aerial shooting of the wild horses. The feral horse count in the national park exploded after then-NSW Nationals leader and deputy premier John Barilaro opposed culls in favour of trapping and rehoming in 2018. The federal government has flagged intervening if the NSW control program is not effective, including a possible push for the zero-tolerance approach employed in the ACT. The federal environment minister, Tanya Pliberse, has long said horses do not belong in the national park and are pushing unique native species towards extinction. Some animal welfare advocates have called for non-lethal brumby controls.

The appointment of Mostyn, a well-regarded business figure and equality advocate, has been met with praise across the political spectrum in parliament, but attracted some ire from select conservative commentators.

The girl was with adults, wading in shallow water on K\u2019gari (formerly known as Fraser Island), about 4.30pm on Wednesday when a dingo approached and bit her on the leg as she crouched down. Nearby witnesses created a distraction and provided assistance. The girl was transported from Yidney beachfront to the Happy Valley ambulance station where she received first aid for minor wounds. Arrangements were made to transport her to the mainland for further medical assessment. Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS) rangers are investigating the incident and working to confirm the identity of the dingo involved. There has been a spate of dingo incidents on the island this year. An 18-year-old woman was bitten on the back of the leg when she was part of a tour group walking to Lake Wabby on 17 February. Hours later a person on a separate tour was nipped while walking on the beachfront near Dilli Village, marking six dingo incidents in as many weeks.

The state government granted an environmental authority to Whitehaven\u2019s Winchester South coalmine in February. The project \u2013 which plans to produce 15m tonnes of thermal and coking coal a year over three decades \u2013 still requires federal government approval. The Australian Conservation Foundation and the Mackay Conservation Group will seek a review of the state\u2019s approval in the Queensland land court. The ACF said the mine would destroy 2,000 hectares of wildlife habitat that is home to threatened and endangered species including koalas, and impact water resources. It would also \u201cimpact human rights due to the climate consequences on generations of Queenslanders\u201d. ACF\u2019s chief executive, Kelly O\u2019Shanassy, said:  This coal mine would be a climate disaster, generating more pollution over its lifetime than every source in Australia does in a year. With the Great Barrier Reef in the midst of yet another serious mass coral bleaching event, the stakes for Queensland and Australia are higher than ever.  The mine, proposed near the town of Moranbah, was recommended for approval by the Queensland coordinator general last year, despite a concession that it \u201chas the capacity to limit human rights\u201d due to \u201cclimate change consequences that may arise from the project\u201d. According to the company\u2019s environmental impact statement, the project would contribute 583m tonnes of greenhouse gas pollution \u2013 more than Australia\u2019s national annual greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 including 14.2m tonnes of on-site emissions and 567m tonnes of scope three emissions created when it is burned overseas. Approximately 58% of the mine\u2019s coal is for steel production, while the other 42% would be exported to Asian countries for use in producing electricity.

The 2024 Board Diversity Index, which analyses Australia\u2019s top 300 ASX listed areas, found the nation has made significant strides in some areas. Since 2015, the number of board positions held by women has surged by 89%, for example. But on other measures, diversity has stalled or isn\u2019t reported. \u201cThey\u2019re still mostly \u2018stale, pale and male\u2019,\u201d the report read. In smaller companies, female representation fell from 44% in 2022 to 32% the year after. There has been no change to the number of First Nations directors. And the number of directors with an Anglo-Celtic background has grown to 91%, up from 90.5% in 2017. Australians with a disability represent about one-fifth of the population, but there appears to be no people from this cohort on ASX300 boards. The information, gathered by Watermark Search International and the Governance Institute of Australia, could be a worrying omen of Australia\u2019s future.

The Minns government announced the new park in south-western Sydney last year to protect koalas and add to a planned north-south movement corridor for the species, which it says will protect about 1,830 hectares of land in total. The park \u2013 which is part of the government\u2019s $80m commitment to protect koalas in the area \u2013 will include bushland in Long Point, Ingleburn, Minto Heights, Kentlyn, Airds, St Helens Park, Gilead and Appin.

It will also give $220,000 worth of grants to the Wollondilly and Liverpool councils for improved signage for motorists in koala \u201chot spots\u201d. The environment department says it is aware of six instances in which koalas have been hit by cars in south-west Sydney in this year alone, and 63 since July 2022. The environment minister, Penny Sharpe, is in Campbelltown today to host a koala forum with 70 local experts and carers. She said:  Too many of these precious animals are getting hurt on roads. These signs will make a real difference by alerting drivers to the risk as they\u2019re passing through the area.     Updated at 11.23pm BST     10.40pm BST       Israeli spokesperson says Hamas regularly uses ambulances and aid workers as cover  One more on the interview with Israeli government spokesperson Avi Hyman. I\u2019m going to give you this full back and forth because I think it\u2019s quite important. He was asked, that if the IDF had information about aid workers\u2019 movements and their cars were clearly identified, how could they have been \u201cmisidentified\u201d by the IDF when all of that information was provided? He says he doesn\u2019t know, but follows with:  What I can tell you, which is what you may be missing \u2026 is that Hamas fights from hospitals, Hamas uses ambulances to transport their terrorists, Hamas shoots from schools, from UN facilities, from mosques.  Sally Sara asks again:  When we\u2019re talking about this particular case. You had information about this, the travelling plans, the vehicles, how could they be misidentified? Are you saying that because you believe genuinely that Hamas are fighting for maybe fighting for medical areas, that you just hit these kinds of convoys anyway? Is that what you\u2019re saying?  Avi Hyman:  Yeah, I\u2019m telling you that war is hell, war is foggy. It was the middle of the night. There was limited visibility. This is just me speculating, which is something that I don\u2019t want to do.  Sara asks, why would he speculate in such an important case as this, particularly when the Australian community is wanting answers about what happened? Hyman:  Because I can tell you definitively that Hamas uses ambulances, uses aid workers as cover for their activities. I can tell you that just at the beginning of the week, we finished a two week operation in the biggest hospital in Gaza that had been turned into a full military base.  But was there evidence in this particular case that militants were in the convoy? Hyman:  There\u2019s an ongoing investigation, like I said, so we don\u2019t we don\u2019t know.     Updated at 11.02pm BST     10.12pm BST       Further reading on Gaza aid worker deaths I\u2019ve got some other news for you unrelated to Gaza in a moment, but here are a couple of pieces we\u2019ve published recently which, if you\u2019re interested in reading more about what happened this week, might help you orient yourself on the issue. Here\u2019s a report from Bethany McKernan in Jerusalem about the incident, including comments from the World Central Kitchen founder, the chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, who said the IDF had targeted the convoy \u201csystematically, car by car\u201d, even though they were in touch with WCK and were aware of the aid workers\u2019 movements.   Related: Israel accused of targeting aid convoy \u2018car by car\u2019 as pressure grows over Gaza tactics    We\u2019ve also got some analysis from Peter Beaumont, Guardian\u2019s veteran (so to speak) war correspondent. He says:  Even though Israel has promised a full and professional investigation into the killing of the aid workers from World Central Kitchen, the reality is that human rights organisations, inside Israel and beyond, have long raised questions about the IDF\u2019s rules, amid allegations that the ones that do exist are being ignored by soldiers and commanders on the ground.

Hyman\u2019s answer, eventually, is that he doesn\u2019t know.  I can only echo the words of the prime minister as the president of the head of the IDF, which is to say that it was a grave mistake. It appears to be a grave, regrettable mistake. And we will do our utmost to look into it to find out exactly what happened. And make sure that nothing like this happens again.     Updated at 10.53pm BST     9.57pm BST       Israeli spokesperson says Hamas stealing food aid and claims of Gaza famine \u2018widely exaggerated\u2019 OK, I\u2019m going back through that interview now \u2013 there was a lot in there, including a number of unverified and heavily disputed allegations, but I\u2019ll try to pull out the most salient points for you. Asked why, when Israel has some of the most sophisticated military technology in the world and in this case, specific information about the aid organisation and their movements vehicles, the military still attacked its vehicles and killed the organisation\u2019s workers, Avi Hyman says:  That\u2019s what makes it all the worse and all the more painful. Because this was one of the organisations who was doing tremendous work that would actually get the aid to the people that need it.  He claims there isn\u2019t a problem getting food into Gaza, but rather, \u201chaving food distributed around Gaza to the people that need it before Hamas and their cronies steal it and take it to their underground lair.\u201d He\u2019s asked what his evidence is for that claim, given even the UN is expressing concern about significant hunger and famine in Gaza. He says:  Obviously the evidence I have is that we are on the ground and know exactly what\u2019s going on in Gaza. What I can tell you is there\u2019s no allegations to my knowledge of actual starvation, actual famine, they\u2019ve been projections on mathematical or mathematical assertions based on false data based on old data based on out of date information.  He claims the risk of famine has been \u201cwildly exaggerated\u201d because the international community wants to stop the war.    Updated at 10.01pm BST     9.46pm BST       After a number of comments about the state of famine in Gaza, which Hyman appears to be disputing \u2013 it\u2019s quite difficult to keep up with his comments, though they seem to include allegations that Hamas is stealing aid \u2013 he is asked by host Sally Sara if he\u2019s rejecting UN concerns of hunger and starvation in Gaza. I will come back and check his comments shortly but the upshot seems to be that he is, more or less. I\u2019ll bring you more direct lines from this interview shortly, bear with me.    Updated at 10.47pm BST     9.40pm BST       Israeli spokesperson suggests killing of aid workers not \u2018on purpose\u2019 and rejects figures of 200 aid workers killed in Gaza Still with an ear to ABC radio, we\u2019re now hearing from Israeli government spokesperson Avi Hyman. He\u2019s asked how the Israeli government can say it\u2019s a mistake rather than a deliberate strike when the investigation is not yet completed? Hyman responds that the \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d suggests it was not intentional:  I mean, obviously, we know that this isn\u2019t something that the IDF would do or the Israeli Air Force would do on purpose.  When it\u2019s put to him that nearly 200 aid workers have been killed in Gaza so far during this war, Hyman says he \u201crejects these numbers\u201d:  There\u2019s a war going on. Wars are awful. Nobody wanted this war, we certainly didn\u2019t want this war, but we\u2019re forced to fight it because it\u2019s a war for our very existence.     Updated at 9.47pm BST     9.31pm BST       Albanese opaque on specifics on cost-of-living measures in budget Moving away from Gaza, Albanese is asked about his comments to the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia last night, where he said cost of living relief for families would be a high priority in this May budget. He effectively dodges the question about whether households can expect the same level of cost of living relief they got last year (cheaper medicines, household bill relief, etc.). Instead he sticks to variations on:  We\u2019re looking at what we can do to provide further cost of living relief without putting pressure on inflation.  Read more on his speech here:   Related: Albanese signals May budget likely to include extension of energy price relief for small business and families      Updated at 9.33pm BST     9.25pm BST       Albanese says killing of of aid workers \u2018completely unacceptable\u2019 Asked about Frankcom\u2019s family\u2019s response to her death (as we mentioned earlier, they\u2019re also calling for an investigation), Albanese says:  They\u2019re very proud of what Zomi was contributing there, her life was about making humanity better, and for her to lose her life [has had] devastating impact. Not just Zomi, of course \u2013 she was one of seven aid workers. But in addition to that, the driver, the Palestinian man who was driving the car to lose, their life in this way is completely unacceptable. And we do need a full investigation and proper accountability. Prime Minister Netanyahu has assured me \u2026 and we need to ensure that the Israeli government is held to account for the commitments that they\u2019ve made.     Updated at 9.33pm BST     9.21pm BST    PM says Israeli government must be \u2018held accountable\u2019 for Gaza aid worker deaths    Albanese says Israel\u2019s government must be \u201cheld accountable\u201d for the deaths of those aid workers:  Humanitarian workers are protected under international law, and the Netanyahu government must publish a full and transparent investigation and they must be held accountable.  He continues:  I had a discussion with the [Israeli] Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday morning where he accepted the responsibility on behalf of the Israeli government for this tragedy, but we need to know exactly how this occurred.  Netanyahu has said it was a case of \u201cmisidentification\u201d. Albanese says that while Israel claims it is protecting the lives of innocent people, but:  [T]his [incident] stands in stark contrast, as well as of course, the many incidents affecting not just people who\u2019ve come from overseas to provide aid but of course Palestinians themselves.     Updated at 9.36pm BST     9.17pm BST       Albanese calls for \u2018full, transparent and clear explanation\u2019 for Israeli killing of aid workers The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking on ABC RN about the death of international aid workers killed in Gaza, including Australian Zomi Frankcom. He says:  We need a full, transparent and clear explanation for how this occurred. People would have seen the footage of the vehicle that was in this struck by an Israeli missile that clearly is identified as being from the World Central Kitchen. These vehicles were going about carrying the best of humanity, people who\u2019d come from all over the world to help Palestinians who are suffering from extraordinary deprivation in Gaza, and for them to lose their life in these circumstances is outrageous and completely unacceptable.

I\u2019m Stephanie Convery and I\u2019ll be with you for the better part of today\u2019s news blog. Hope you\u2019re all caffeinated and breakfasted, as it is promising to be a busy one.    Updated at 9.10pm BST     8.58pm BST    Thunderstorms, heavy rain and possible flash flooding for eastern Australia    Two weather systems are colliding to bring thunderstorms, heavy rain and possible flash flooding across eastern Australia, AAP reports. The troughs are passing over each other causing the wild weather in Queensland\u2019s south and northern NSW, the Bureau of Meteorology says. Rainfall totals up to 200mm are forecast across both states in coming days. In Queensland, residents are being told to prepare for flash flooding. The Darling Downs, Granite Belt and Maranoa in Queensland\u2019s southwest are forecast to get thunderstorm activity on Thursday with widespread rainfall totals between 20mm and 50mm. Isolated falls that increase the risk of flooding could be up to 100mm in towns from Charleville to Goondiwindi and over to the Gold Coast. A flood watch has been issued for dozens of catchments across the state\u2019s south-west including the Paroo River, Wallam and Mungallala Creeks and Moonie River. The bureau said floodwaters could rise on Thursday night. For residents near the Moonie and Condamine rivers, it marks just a few months since river levels rose, flooding homes in a January emergency. The weather system will move south into northern NSW developing into a low pressure system, bringing widespread rain of 30mm to 50mm and up to 100mm in some areas. The bureau\u2019s Miriam Bradbury warned the weather system will bring severe storms with heavy rain, strong winds and high sea swells. The New England and Northern Rivers regions are anticipating the first wave of wild weather before the system tracks further south to the Hunter, Sydney, Blue Mountains and Illawarra on Friday. NSW State Emergency Services are preparing for the worst with residents urged to get ready for the storms. A flood watch is in place for the Mid North Coast, Sydney region, South Coast and parts of the north west. Major flooding is possible on the Hawkesbury Nepean River from Friday.    Updated at 9.03pm BST     8.53pm BST    Relatives of British Gaza victims echo 'disappointment' of Zomi Frankcom's family    The description by Zomi Frankcom\u2019s family of Israel\u2019s response to her death as \u201cdisappointing\u201d has been echoed by families of three British vounteers killed in the same incident in Gaza on Monday. James Kirby, a 47-year-old former Army sniper, and John Chapman, 57, worked in the charity\u2019s security team and died alongside fellow British military veteran James Henderson, 33.    Adam McGuire, a relative of Kirby, said he was \u201cone of those characters who, once you met him, was hard to forget\u201d. But he said the family was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s response on Tuesday, adding: \u201cWe hope from James\u2019s side and possibly the other six that this is the turning point. We hope we can get a ceasefire and humanitarian aid can get into Gaza.\u201d As in Australia, the incident has increased pressure on the UK government to take a tougher stance on Israel\u2019s use of force in Gaza. Ministers in Rishi Sunak\u2019s government are under pressure from their own MPs and peers to stop arming Israel. There\u2019s also an increasing pushback against UK support for Israel with a poll finding that arms exports to the country should be stopped.    Updated at 8.55pm BST     8.53pm BST    Welcome    Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019ll be running through of the top stories you need to know about this morning before my colleague logs on to take you through the day. The family of Zomi Frankcom, the Australian aid worker killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, have backed calls for a war crimes investigation into the incident. Two Australian experts in international law have said there are grounds for a war crimes investigation into her death in the bombing alongside six other aid workers.  Speaking to the Nine newspapers, family members said they would support the calls for an investigation. \u201cIt should never have happened,\u201d said Frankcom\u2019s brother Mal and other family members.  They said that the response by the Israeli government so far had been \u201cdisappointing\u201d and added: \u201cThe lives of humanitarian workers should always be protected.\u201d It comes as the families of three British aid workers killed alongside Frankcom paid tribute to their loved ones as \u201cheroes\u201d. Stand by for more reaction to this. Anthony Albanese will give the strongest signal yet that the government will extend energy price relief when he uses a speech in Sydney today to declare that small businesses and families will be \u201cfront and centre\u201d in the May budget. In an address to the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, the prime minister will say that the cost of living measure has \u201chelped people under pressure \u2013 and it helped fight inflation\u201d, signalling the support of up to $650 to 1m small businesses and 5m families will probably be rolled out in the May budget.  Albanese will also speak about the need to encourage uptake of rooftop solar, and take aim at the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, for trying to enlist small business into his \u201cpolitics of negativity and conflict\u201d. More coming up. Today was supposed to be the day we learned the verdict in the Bruce Lehrmann defamation saga. Instead, a little-known former Seven producer will give testimony in the federal court that could potentially change the outcome.

But the Coalition opposition refused to say explicitly whether the Israeli military had breached international law, saying it \u201ctakes more care than Hamas does to protect civilian lives\u201d. The opposition\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, said the world cannot \u201cbe so naive as to pretend tragedies and mistakes don\u2019t occur in a war\u201d, but Israel \u201cshould be learning from each of these mistakes\u201d and allow more aid into Gaza.   Related: Israeli inquiry findings on aid worker killings lack credibility, charity says    The Australian government has demanded full accountability and transparency from Israel over the triple-strike on the World Central Kitchen convoy last Monday that killed seven humanitarian workers, including the Australian citizen Zomi Frankcom. Husic said Frankcom and her colleagues joined \u201cnearly 200 humanitarian workers who have lost their lives in this conflict\u201d, citing UN figures. \u201cI believe this reflects a systematic failure within the Israeli government to genuinely commit to the observance of international humanitarian law,\u201d Husic, the industry minister, told Sky News on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen 33,000 Palestinians killed, 14,500 of which are children, and 77,000 injured \u2013 and then on top of that, 200 aid workers [and] 100 journalists. \u201cI mean, this comes down to a failure by the Israeli government to observe international law distinguishing between combatant and civilian.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Late on Friday, the Israeli military published a summary of initial findings, saying the strike on the aid vehicles last Monday was \u201ca grave mistake stemming from a serious failure due to a mistaken identification, errors in decision-making, and an attack contrary to the standard operating procedures\u201d. WCK said it had fully coordinated its movements with the Israel Defense Forces and has demanded an independent investigation. The IDF said its personnel thought they were targeting Hamas gunmen in the fatal drone strikes. It announced that a major and a colonel would be dismissed from their positions, while three others would be formally reprimanded. Husic said \u201cit would be the easiest route to use the \u2018bad apples\u2019 defence here, that it was a couple of people that operated outside of policy\u201d, but he argued broader changes were needed. He said the Australian government\u2019s plan to appoint its own special adviser to scrutinise the investigation was \u201ca very big step by our government\u201d to ensure \u201cwe get to the bottom of what\u2019s happened\u201d. Husic said the Australian government had called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza since December, but was also demanding Hamas release the more than 130 hostages it holds in order to make any ceasefire \u201cdurable\u201d. He said the international landscape was \u201cthe most contestable it has been in decades\u201d and \u201cthe worst thing for the west is a perception of hypocrisy when it comes to crises like this\u201d. \u201cWe need to be able to demonstrate our values, and in particular our defence of international humanitarian law,\u201d Husic said. \u201cAnd the Coalition has been utterly silent on this, or at other times been very weak, particularly this week, in acknowledging that Israel crossed a line, and that Zomi Frankcom paid the price for the crossing of that line.\u201d In a later interview on the ABC\u2019s Insiders program, Birmingham said Frankcom\u2019s death \u201cshouldn\u2019t have happened\u201d and was \u201cwrong\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy in a sea of tragedies that dates all the way back through to October 7, when of course we saw another Australian, Galit Carbone, also killed, at the hands though of Hamas who instigated the cycle of violence that has been occurring since October 7 through their barbaric terrorist actions,\u201d he said.   Related: \u2018Deadly failure\u2019: Australia demands Israel take \u2018appropriate action\u2019 against those responsible for killing aid workers    Birmingham declined to say whether the incident that killed Frankcom was a breach of international law, arguing he was \u201cnot either qualified nor in position of all of the facts to give that legal judgment\u201d. \u201cWe have expectations in terms of the investigations that should occur, but we cannot turn away or be so naive as to pretend that tragedies and mistakes don\u2019t occur in a war. They do. They happen all the time. It\u2019s a terrible thing. We wish it wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and his ministers have previously rebuked the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, for saying in his initial response that \u201cthis happens in wartime\u201d. The foreign minister, Penny Wong, told Guardian Australia\u2019s Australian Politics podcast this was a \u201cdeeply insensitive thing\u201d for Netanyahu to say. Asked repeatedly whether Israel needed to \u201ctake greater care\u201d to protect civilian lives, Birmingham said: \u201cIsrael needs to take care with the protection of civilian lives \u2026 consistent with its obligations under international law.\u201d Birmingham said mistakes should trigger changes, but Israel was being held to \u201cfar higher\u201d standards than was applied to Hamas, which hid behind civilians and civilian infrastructure and was committed to the elimination of Israel. \u201cThat\u2019s why that terrorist organisation needs to be removed from any position of influence, governance or threat, such that we can actually move into a more peaceful negotiation environment in the future,\u201d Birmingham said.", "Russia warns against travel to Middle East amid fears of Iranian attack on Israel \u2013 as it happened [2024-04-11T14:06:56Z]": "  3.06pm BST    Closing summary    It has just gone 4pm in Gaza and 5pm in Tel Aviv and Beirut. We will be closing this blog soon, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian\u2019s Middle East coverage here. Here is a recap of the latest developments:  Russia\u2019s foreign ministry on Thursday advised against travel to the Middle East and German airline Lufthansa extended a suspension of its flights to Tehran, as the region was kept on edge by Iran\u2019s threat to retaliate against Israel for an attack in Syria. Lufthansa said on Wednesday it had suspended flights to Tehran due to the situation in the Middle East. On Thursday, the airline said this had been extended until probably 13 April. A video has surfaced of a senior official at Israel\u2019s cyber intelligence agency, Unit 8200, talking last year about the use of machine learning \u201cmagic powder\u201d to help identify Hamas targets in Gaza. The footage raises questions about the accuracy of a recent statement about use of artificial intelligence (AI) by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which said it \u201cdoes not use an artificial intelligence system that identifies terrorist operatives or tries to predict whether a person is a terrorist\u201d. Israeli forces killed three sons of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in an airstrike in Gaza without consulting senior commanders or political leaders including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli media reports said on Thursday. Quoting senior Israeli officials, Walla news agency said neither Netanyahu nor defence minister Yoav Gallant had been told in advance of the strike, which was coordinated by the Israeli military and the Shin Bet intelligence service. Haniyeh said the Israeli attack that killed three of his sons and at least two grandchildren would not change Hamas\u2019s demands for a permanent ceasefire and return of displaced Palestinians from their homes in ongoing negotiations mediated by Doha and Washington. \u201cAll our people and all the families of Gaza have paid a heavy price in blood, and I am one of them,\u201d Haniyeh said. The Israeli military statement confirmed it had targeted Haniyeh\u2019s sons, who it described as \u201cthree Hamas operatives\u201d who were \u201con their way to carry out terrorist activities\u201d but did not comment on reports that Haniyeh\u2019s grandchildren had also been killed. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on Wednesday offered condolences in a phone call to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh after the death of his three sons in Gaza, his office said. \u201cPresident Erdo\u011fan stressed that Israel will definitely be held to account before law for the crimes of humanity it has been committing,\u201d his office said in a statement on social media. Israel\u2019s foreign ministry on Thursday denounced Ireland\u2019s new prime minister Simon Harris for not mentioning the hostages held by militants in Gaza during a speech to the Irish parliament. Harris \u2013 who was sworn in on Tuesday \u2013 \u201cforgot\u201d to \u201cmention the 133 Israeli hostages who have been rotting in Hamas tunnels for the past six months,\u201d Israel\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. The US president, Joe Biden, has vowed that US commitment to defend Israel against Iran was \u201cironclad\u201d. The US secretary of state Antony Blinken has also made clear that the US will stand with Israel against any threats from Iran, in a call with Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant on Wednesday, according to the state department. Iranian threats to carry out a missile strike against Israel are \u201cunacceptable\u201d, the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said as he reaffirmed the UK\u2019s support for Tel Aviv\u2019s right to defend itself. Speaking to broadcasters on Thursday, Sunak condemned the Ayatollah\u2019s comments, saying they were \u201cunacceptable\u201d. He said: \u201cWe, like the Americans, fully support Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against that.\u201d German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock called her Iranian counterpart Hossein Amirabdollahian to urge \u201cmaximum restraint\u201d to avoid further escalation, Reuters reported on Thursday. The US Middle East envoy Brett McGurk has reportedly called the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Iraq, asking them to deliver a message to Tehran to lower tensions with Israel. The Reuters news agency, citing a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity, says that McGurk asked the officials to contact the Iranian foreign minister and convey the message \u2013 which they are reported to have done. McGurk\u2019s calls were first reported by Axios but the White House has declined to comment. At least 33,545 Palestinians have been killed and 76,094 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Thursday. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is continuing its war in Gaza but is also preparing for scenarios in other arenas, the Times of Israel reports. \u201cWe are in challenging times. We are in the midst of a war in Gaza that is continuing with full force \u2026 but we are also preparing for challenges from other fronts,\u201d the website reports Netanyahu telling pilots at an air force base in southern Israel. It has been reported by US media that Hamas does not have 40 living hostages who fit the criteria needed for an exchange under a proposed ceasefire deal. In an article published on Wednesday, The New York Times cites a senior Israeli official and a senior Hamas official as the sources. CNN also reported the claims, saying sources had told the news outlet that Hamas had informed international mediators it does not have the required number of living hostages who fit the criteria, including women, sick and elderly men. It also says that Israel is now pushing for Hamas to instead include younger male hostages, as well as soldiers in an initial release. The Guardian has been unable to verify the reports. The Kremlin on Thursday called for all countries in the Middle East to show restraint and prevent the region slipping into chaos. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there had been no requests for Russia to mediate between Israel and Iran, though Peskov said the Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus was a violation of all the principles of international law. US senator Tim Kaine, a former vice-presidential nominee and leading foreign policy voice in the Democratic party, has said Joe Biden, now understands that Benjamin Netanyahu \u201cplayed\u201d him during the early months of the war in Gaza but \u201cthat ain\u2019t going to happen any more\u201d. In an interview with the Guardian on Tuesday, Kaine accused the prime minister of making Israel \u201cdramatically less safe\u201d and hurting its longstanding relationship with the US, and said the US president had come to realise the limits of his influence. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had struck a building used by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, reported the Times of Israel on Thursday. The IDF also said tanks had shelled an area near Tayr Harfa to \u201cremove a threat\u201d. Several countries including France and Jordan airdropped about 110 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Gaza, the French president and military said. The French military on Wednesday said the UK and Germany were involved in the operation, the largest France had taken part in so far. The UN deputy secretary general Amina J Mohammed said that \u201chumanity\u201d and the \u201cinternational community\u201d has \u201clost\u201d its \u201cmoral compass on Gaza\u201d. In a social media post shared on Thursday by the UN, Mohammed urged action, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re late.\u201d The US military said on Thursday that it had shot down 11 drones belonging to Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi rebels, after the group claimed it had targeted Israeli and US ships off the Gulf of Aden. The latest Houthi attacks targeted two Israeli ships as well as a US commercial vessel and a US warship, the Houthis said in a statement. The United Nations Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa) has been awarded a Spanish civil order of chivalry and honour by the king of Spain. Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general of Unrwa, posted on social media on Thursday that it was \u201can honour\u201d to receive the award. \u201cThis is in recognition of the extraordinary service of our teams wherever they are including in Gaza,\u201d wrote Lazzarini.        3.04pm BST    UK prime minister says Iranian threats against Israel are 'unacceptable'    Iranian threats to carry out a missile strike against Israel are \u201cunacceptable\u201d, the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said as he reaffirmed the UK\u2019s support for Tel Aviv\u2019s right to defend itself, reports the Press Association (PA). Tehran has vowed to retaliate after two of its top generals were killed in an airstrike on its consulate in Syria earlier this month that the US military believes was carried out by Israel. Although Israel has not commented on the attack, Iran\u2019s leader the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the country \u201cmust be punished and it shall be\u201d.    Speaking to broadcasters on Thursday, Sunak condemned the Ayatollah\u2019s comments, saying they were \u201cunacceptable\u201d. He said: \u201cWe, like the Americans, fully support Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against that.\u201d According to the Press Association, Sunak added that Britain had already \u201chighlighted Iran as a significant risk to regional security\u201d and taken steps to protect the UK from threats from Tehran. Thursday also brought the repatriation of three British aid workers killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. James Kirby, Jim Henderson and John Chapman were working for the aid group World Central Kitchen when their convoy was struck in an attack that killed four other aid workers. Their families paid tribute to the three men, with Kirby\u2019s saying he would be \u201cmissed by many\u201d while Henderson\u2019s described him as \u201cour shining light\u201d. Chapman\u2019s family said he would be \u201cmissed deeply\u201d and was \u201can inspiration to many\u201d.       2.59pm BST       Here are some of the latest images on the newswires:                 2.30pm BST    German foreign minister calls Iranian counterpart and urges 'maximum restraint' to avoid further escalation    Reuters reports that German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock called her Iranian counterpart Hossein Amirabdollahian to urge \u201cmaximum restraint\u201d to avoid further escalation. Iran has vowed revenge for the 1 April airstrike on its embassy compound in Damascus which killed a top Iranian general and six other Iranian military officers. Iran blames Israel for this, however, Israel has not declared its responsibility for the attack. On Wednesday, Israel\u2019s foreign minister threatened that its country\u2019s forces would strike Iran directly if the Islamic Republic launched an attack from its territory against Israel. The Kremlin on Thursday called for all countries in the Middle East to show restraint and prevent the region slipping into chaos.    Updated at 2.30pm BST     2.11pm BST       US senator Tim Kaine, a former vice-presidential nominee and leading foreign policy voice in the Democratic party, has said Joe Biden, now understands that Benjamin Netanyahu \u201cplayed\u201d him during the early months of the war in Gaza but \u201cthat ain\u2019t going to happen any more\u201d. In an interview with the Guardian on Tuesday, Kaine accused the prime minister of making Israel \u201cdramatically less safe\u201d and hurting its longstanding relationship with the US, and said the US president had come to realise the limits of his influence. The Democratic senator for Virginia is best known nationally as Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate in the 2016 presidential election, a race they lost to Republicans Donald Trump and Mike Pence. The Biden ally is a member of the Senate foreign relations and armed services committees. Kaine has repeatedly reiterated his backing for Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against Hamas following the terrorist attack six months ago that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 people hostage. But he has joined other Democrats in expressing growing consternation over a hardline military response that has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry, and spurred a looming famine.

Updated at 1.05pm BST     12.39pm BST       Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is continuing its war in Gaza but is also preparing for scenarios in other arenas, the Times of Israel reports. \u201cWe are in challenging times. We are in the midst of a war in Gaza that is continuing with full force. In addition, we are continuing with ceaseless efforts to return our hostages, but we are also preparing for challenges from other fronts,\u201d the website reports Netanyahu telling pilots at an air force base in southern Israel. \u201cWe set a simple principle: Anyone who hits us, we hit them,\u201d Netanyahu said, in apparent reference to Iranian threats to carry out strikes against Israel. \u201cWe are ready to fulfil our responsibilities to Israel\u2019s security, in defence and attack.\u201d He was speaking amid concern that Iran was preparing to strike Israel in response for the killing of senior Iranian commanders.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there had been no requests for Russia to mediate between Israel and Iran, though Peskov said the Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus was a violation of all the principles of international law.       11.44am BST       It has been reported by US media that Hamas does not have 40 living hostages who fit the criteria needed for an exchange under a proposed ceasefire deal.  In an article published on Wednesday, The New York Times cites a senior Israeli official and a senior Hamas official as the sources. According to the NYT, \u201cIsrael had been relayed Hamas\u2019s claim, and the senior Hamas official said that the group had informed mediators facilitating the negotiations\u201d. The publication said the Israeli official and the Hamas official requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. CNN also reported the claims on Wednesday, saying sources had told the news outlet that Hamas had informed international mediators it does not have the required number of living hostages who fit the criteria, including women, sick and elderly men.  It also says that Israel is now pushing for Hamas to instead include younger male hostages, as well as soldiers in an initial release.

Iran has vowed revenge for the 1 April airstrike on its embassy compound in Damascus which killed a top Iranian general and six other Iranian military officers. Israel has not declared its responsibility for the attack. According to Reuters, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry told citizens they should refrain from travelling to the Middle East, especially to Israel, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. \u201cWe strongly recommend that Russian citizens refrain from traveling to the region, especially to Israel, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, except in cases of extreme necessity,\u201d it said. \u201cThe tense situation in the Middle East region persists,\u201d said the foreign ministry, which first issued such travel advice in October when it urged Russians not to visit Israel and the Palestinian territories after Hamas attacked Israel.    Lufthansa said on Wednesday it had suspended flights to Tehran due to the situation in the Middle East. On Thursday, the airline said this had been extended until probably 13 April. A spokesperson said Lufthansa had decided not to operate a flight from Frankfurt to Tehran last weekend to avoid the crew having to disembark to spend the night in the Iranian capital, say Reuters. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Austrian Airlines are the only two western carriers flying into Tehran, which is mostly served by Turkish and Middle Eastern airlines. Austrian Airlines, which flies from Vienna to Tehran six times a week, said it was still planning to fly on Thursday but was adjusting timings to avoid an overnight layover. According to Reuters, there was no immediate word from other international airlines that fly to Tehran.       10.36am BST    Israel\u2019s foreign ministry denounce Irish PM for not mentioning Gaza hostages in speech    Israel\u2019s foreign ministry on Thursday denounced Ireland\u2019s new prime minister Simon Harris for not mentioning the hostages held by militants in Gaza during a speech to the Irish parliament, report Agence France-Presse (AFP). AFP also say that Israel is furious with Ireland over its intention to recognise a Palestinian state and to intervene in the genocide case brought by South Africa against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Harris \u2013 who was sworn in on Tuesday \u2013 \u201cforgot\u201d to \u201cmention the 133 Israeli hostages who have been rotting in Hamas tunnels for the past six months,\u201d Israel\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. It said Ireland was also \u201cplanning to award additional prizes to terrorism\u201d by backing South Africa, which it called \u201cthe legal arm of the Hamas terrorist organisation, and the possible recognition of a Palestinian state in the future.\u201d \u201cAfter the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust \u2026 there are those in Ireland who persist on being on the wrong side of history,\u201d the statement added.    According to AFP, Harris, 37, Ireland\u2019s youngest ever taoiseach, told the Irish parliament on Tuesday that \u201cinnocent children, women and men are being starved and slaughtered\u201d in Gaza. \u201cWe have not been silent on the unforgiveable terrorist actions of Hamas on 7 October, nor can we be silent on the disproportionate reaction of the Israeli government,\u201d said the leader of the centre-right Fine Gael party. In a 27 March statement declaring that it would intervene at the ICJ, Ireland\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs cited \u201ctaking of hostages\u201d as among violations of international humanitarian law that have occurred in Israel and Gaza since 7 October. The leaders of Ireland, Malta and Slovenia, in a joint statement with Spain on 22 March, expressed \u201creadiness to recognise Palestine\u201d when \u201cthe circumstances are right\u201d.       10.23am BST       Here are some of the latest images on the newswires:              Updated at 10.25am BST     10.06am BST    Netanyahu not consulted on killing of Hamas leader's sons, Israeli media say    Israeli forces killed three sons of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in an airstrike in Gaza without consulting senior commanders or political leaders including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, says Reuters citing Israeli media reports on Thursday. Quoting senior Israeli officials, Walla news agency said neither Netanyahu nor defence minister Yoav Gallant had been told in advance of the strike, which was coordinated by the Israeli military and the Shin Bet intelligence service. It said Amir, Mohammad and Hazem Haniyeh had been targeted as fighters and not because they were the sons of Hamas\u2019s political leader. The Israeli military did not comment on reports that four of Haniyeh\u2019s grandchildren had also been killed, reports Reuters. The international news agency said no comment on the Walla report was immediately available from the prime minister\u2019s office or the military.    The killing of Haniyeh\u2019s relatives has added a potential complication to negotiations aimed at securing a halt in the fighting in Gaza in exchange for the return of the 133 Israeli hostages still believed to be held there. However, Haniyeh said Hamas had \u201cclear and specific\u201d demands for agreeing to any pause in the fighting. \u201cThe enemy will be delusional if it thinks that targeting my sons, at the climax of the negotiations and before the movement sends its response, will push Hamas to change its position,\u201d Haniyeh said on Wednesday. Global calls for a ceasefire have been growing as the war has entered its seventh month but there has been little sign of progress in the talks. Hamas is demanding an end to the Israeli offensive, a withdrawal of Israeli forces and permission for Gaza\u2019s displaced Palestinians to return to their homes. Israel wants to secure the return of the hostages but says it will not end the war until Hamas is destroyed as a military force, and that it is still planning to assault the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million civilians have taken refuge.       9.56am BST    International community has 'lost' its 'moral compass on Gaza', says UN deputy secretary general    The UN deputy secretary general Amina J Mohammed has said that \u201chumanity\u201d and the \u201cinternational community\u201d has \u201clost\u201d its \u201cmoral compass on Gaza\u201d.

The airdrops come as Muslims in the Gaza Strip mark a desperately sad Eid al-Fitr for the end of the Ramadan fasting month, with little food and after Israeli bombardment overnight killed 14 people including children, according to the health ministry there, reports AFP. Aid workers have repeatedly urged Israel to allow more food convoys in through the land border with Egypt, where trucks have been waiting in long lines for permission. They say the overland route is more efficient and cheaper than airdrops.       7.54am BST       Jason Burke and Malak A Tantesh in Rafah have reported on how Palestinians in Gaza marked the end of Ramadan in the shadow of war. Here is a snippet from the feature: As cold, driving rain swept across the rubbish- and rubble-strewn streets of Rafah early on Wednesday morning, residents of the crowded city in the south of Gaza set out to celebrate the end of the holy month of Ramadan and the festival of Eid al-Fitr. Prayers were held in mosques badly damaged in the continuing Israeli offensive, in the crowded schools where many have lived since being forced to flee ruined homes elsewhere in the territory, and on the sand among the rows of tents now home to hundreds of thousands.    By noon, the clouds had cleared but the spring sun brought little of the warmth usually associated with a day of faith, friendship and family. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like Eid because of the lack of a beautiful atmosphere, and we are not buying clothes and sweets, or gathering together like we usually do,\u201d said Jana Muhammad Sorour, a 12-year-old dispatched by her displaced family to sell homemade goods to neighbours in Rafah to raise much-needed funds. \u201cI hope that the war will stop and that I will get clothes and candy like other holidays, and most importantly, go home.\u201d You can read the full piece here:   Related: \u2018This cannot be Eid\u2019: Gaza\u2019s survivors mark the end of Ramadan in the shadow of war         7.32am BST    Hamas leader repeats Gaza ceasefire call after sons and grandchildren killed    Three sons and at least two grandchildren of the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, have been killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip, the exiled political chief of the militant group has said from his base in the Qatari capital of Doha. Haniyeh told Al Jazeera on Wednesday that his children Hazem, Amir and Mohammed and several of their children were visiting relatives for Eid at the Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza when their car was targeted in an Israeli airstrike. Sixty of his relatives had been killed in the six-month-old war, he said, including 14 who died after an Israeli airstrike hit the family home in Gaza City in October. The Hamas leader said the attack would not change the group\u2019s demands for a permanent ceasefire and return of displaced Palestinians from their homes in ongoing negotiations mediated by Doha and Washington. \u201cAll our people and all the families of Gaza have paid a heavy price in blood, and I am one of them,\u201d Haniyeh said. The Israeli military statement confirmed it had targeted Haniyeh\u2019s sons, who it described as \u201cthree Hamas operatives\u201d who were \u201con their way to carry out terrorist activities\u201d.

The Reuters news agency, citing a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity, says that McGurk asked the officials to contact the Iranian foreign minister and convey the message \u2013 which they are reported to have done. McGurk\u2019s calls were first reported by Axios but the White House has declined to comment. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Israel \u201cmust be punished and it shall be\u201d for the Damascus strike that killed seven Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps members. Israel has not confirmed it was behind the strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria, but the Pentagon has said it was. Iran\u2019s foreign ministry said on Wednesday the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and Iraq spoke on the phone with Iran\u2019s foreign minister and discussed regional tensions. Those tensions have flared and spread since Israel launched its war in Gaza in the wake of the Hamas 7 October attacks. Most recently, the US president, Joe Biden, has vowed that US commitment to defend Israel against Iran was \u201cironclad\u201d. The US secretary of state Antony Blinken has also made clear that the US will stand with Israel against any threats from Iran, in a call with Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant on Wednesday, according to the state department.

This is our latest Guardian live blog on the Israel-Gaza war and the wider Middle East crisis. The US Middle East envoy Brett McGurk has called the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and Iraq to ask Tehran to lower tensions with Israel, Reuters reports, citing a source. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Israel \u201cmust be punished and it shall be\u201d for the strike on Iran\u2019s embassy in Syria that killed seven Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps members. Israel was suspected to be behind the attack but it has not acknowledged its involvement. McGurk\u2019s calls were first reported by Axios. More on that in a moment but first, here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments:  US president Joe Biden has vowed that US commitment to defend Israel against Iran was \u201cironclad\u201d as concerns rose in Washington that a \u201csignificant\u201d Iranian strike could happen within days, in retaliation for the bombing of an Iranian consular building in Damascus. US and allied officials fear that a strike is imminent and could come in the form of a direct missile launch from Iran, rather than an attack through a proxy like Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated on Wednesday a promise to retaliate against Israel over the killings of Iranian generals in Syria. Israel has not acknowledged its involvement. Khamenei spoke at a prayer ceremony, saying the airstrike that demolished Iran\u2019s consulate in Syria earlier this month was \u201cwrongdoing\u201d against a diplomatic post that is considered Iranian territory. \u201cThe evil regime must be punished, and it will be punished,\u201d he said. Israel\u2019s foreign minister threatened on Wednesday that its country\u2019s forces would strike Iran directly if the Islamic Republic launched an attack from its territory against Israel. \u201cIf Iran attacks from its territory, Israel will respond and attack in Iran,\u201d Israel Katz said in a post on X in both Farsi and Hebrew. Iran\u2019s Mehr news agency removed a report on Wednesday from its official channel on X that had said the country was closing its airspace over the capital Tehran and denied in a new post that it had published any such news. In the original report posted on X, the semi-official news agency cited the Iranian defence minister as saying that all air traffic had been suspended over Tehran from 2030 GMT on Wednesday \u201cdue to military drills\u201d. Axios is reporting that the senior US military commander in charge of the Middle East is expected to go to Israel on Thursday to coordinate around a possible attack on Israel, two Israeli officials told the news outlet. The commander of the US military central command (Centcom) Gen Erik Kurilla is expected to meet senior Israel Defense Forces (IDF) officials and Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant, reports Axios. US secretary of state Antony Blinken, has also made clear that the US will stand with Israel against any threats from Iran, in a call with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Wednesday, according to the state department. Three sons and at least two grandchildren of the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, have been killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip, the exiled political chief of the militant group has said from his base in the Qatari capital of Doha. Haniyeh told Al Jazeera on Wednesday that his children Hazem, Amir and Mohammed and several of their children were visiting relatives for Eid at the Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza when their car was targeted in an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli military statement confirmed it had targeted Haniyeh\u2019s sons, who it described as \u201cthree Hamas operatives\u201d. The Hamas leader said the attack would not change the group\u2019s demands for a permanent ceasefire. Israel has agreed in ceasefire talks in Egypt to concessions about the return of Palestinians to the north of Gaza, but believes Hamas does not want to strike a deal, Israeli officials told Reuters on Wednesday. Two officials with knowledge of the talks told the news agency that under a US proposal for a truce, Israel would allow the return of 150,000 Palestinians to north Gaza with no security checks. In return, they said, Hamas would be required to give a list of female, elderly and sick hostages it still holds alive. Netanyahu\u2019s office declined to comment. It is being reported that Hamas does not have 40 living hostages who fit the criteria needed for an exchange under a proposed ceasefire deal. The New York Times is citing a senior Israeli official as the source. CNN also reported the claims earlier, saying sources had told the news outlet that Hamas had informed international mediators it does not have the required number of living hostages who fit the criteria, including women, sick and elderly men. It also says that Israel is now pushing for Hamas to instead include younger male hostages, as well as soldiers in an initial release. Israeli War Cabinet minister Benny Gantz has claimed Hamas has been defeated militarily, although he also said Israel will fight it for years to come. \u201cFrom a military point of view, Hamas is defeated. Its fighters are eliminated or in hiding\u201d and its capabilities \u201ccrippled,\u201d Gantz said in a statement to the media in the southern Israeli city of Sderot. But he added: \u201cFighting against Hamas will take time. Boys who are now in middle school will still fight in the Gaza Strip,\u201d reports the Associated Press. Aid shipments to Gaza are expected to resume soon from Cyprus, officials said on Wednesday. The US plans to set up a dock, with a target date of 1 May, on Gaza\u2019s Mediterranean coast that will enable aid deliveries which will be pre-screened in Cyprus, with Israeli oversight. With that jetty in place, Cyprus expects aid to resume soon, Cypriot president Nikos Christodoulides said. Israeli forces kept up combat operations and airstrikes on Gaza on Wednesday, reported AFP, a day after Netanyahu vowed no let up in the campaign to destroy Hamas and bring home the hostages. Netanyahu insisted on that \u201cno force in the world\u201d would stop Israeli troops from entering Gaza\u2019s far-southern city of Rafah which is packed with displaced Palestinians. Eid al-Fitr was observed by Muslims across the world on Wednesday, including in Gaza, where Eid prayers were held outside the ruins of a mosque in Rafah to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Some displaced worshippers knelt on plastic tarpaulin outside tents where they are living after Israeli offensives destroyed their homes and infrastructure. According to the UN, 95% of pregnant and breastfeeding women in Gaza are not getting adequate food or nutrition. In a release published by the UN\u2019s Population Fund (UNFPA), that was updated on 2 April, the UN agency warned that about 155,000 pregnant women and new mothers were \u201cstruggling to survive\u201d. At least 33,482 Palestinians have been killed and 76,049 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, according to the latest figures from the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez warned on Wednesday that Israel\u2019s \u201cdisproportionate response\u201d in the Gaza war with Hamas risks \u201cdestabilising the Middle East, and as a consequence, the entire world\u201d. S\u00e1nchez also insisted that the recognition of a Palestinian state, long resisted by Israel and its key allies, is \u201cin Europe\u2019s geopolitical interests\u201d. It is as the Palestine ambassador to Ireland welcomed Dublin\u2019s promise to formally recognise Palestinian statehood and hoped other EU members will follow. The US Central Command (Centcom) says that its forces successfully engaged three unmanned aerial vehicles launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen over the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea. There were no injuries or damage reported, the statement added.

Ratnam on Thursday announced she has nominated for preselection to contest the federal seat of Wills, which takes in the northern Melbourne suburbs of Brunswick, Coburg, Glenroy, Fawkner and Pascoe Vale. It is held by Labor MP Peter Khalil on a margin of 8.6% on a two-candidate-preferred basis against the Greens. But senior Labor figures have expressed concerned that the margin could narrow, amid backlash over the party\u2019s response to the Hamas-Israel war.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  In recent months, Khalil\u2019s Coburg office has been targeted by pro-Palestine protesters. On one occasion, effigies were left outside the Sydney Road office along with signs \u201cend the occupation\u201d, \u201cfree Palestine\u201d and \u201cno more bodies in Gaza\u201d. On hearing of Ratnam\u2019s candidacy, a senior Victorian Labor figure said: \u201cBye bye Peter.\u201d \u201cIf things don\u2019t change or the seat doesn\u2019t change [in the upcoming redistribution], we are in huge trouble,\u201d they said.   Related: Crossbench demands donations reform after $16m in \u2018dark money\u2019 flows into voice campaign    The Labor figure said there was a \u201cmisconception\u201d among the party that Muslim voters, who have traditionally voted Labor, would continue to do so out of concern the Greens were \u201ctoo socially progressive\u201d. \u201cThe Muslim community are feeling really hurt and disappointed by Labor and it\u2019s not enough for us to counter it with: \u2018The Greens are too radical, you can\u2019t vote for them\u2019,\u201d they said. \u201cThere is an impression amongst this group that the Greens are the only ones sticking up for them at the moment. We need to do more.\u201d The Albanese government has hardened its position on Israel after the killing of an Australian aid worker in Gaza earlier this week, and has been calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire since December. Gaza was highlighted by the federal Greens leader, Adam Bandt, in a statement following Ratnam\u2019s nomination, alongside the issues of housing affordability and the rental crisis. \u201cPeter Khalil and Labor have failed renters, failed people who are trying to buy their first home, and failed to condemn the state of Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza,\u201d Bandt said. \u201cThe people of Wills are progressive and compassionate but their values are being betrayed by a Labor party approving new coal and gas projects and backing the invasion of Gaza, while ignoring renters and offering Band-Aid solutions to the cost-of-living crisis. \u201cThe people of Wills can send Labor a message without helping Peter Dutton.\u201d   Related: Victorian Greens threaten to block planning changes unless housing demands met    He said only one in 10 voters needed to change their vote for the party to win the seat and noted 40% of the electorate were renters. Colin Jacobs, a former Greens staffer who is now the director of data and analytics at firm PoliQ, said there was \u201ca lot of room for growth\u201d for the minor party. He said while Brunswick was now \u201cGreens heartland territory\u201d, Labor had been able to rely on the \u201chipster-proof fence\u201d \u2013 the different demographics north of Bell Street \u2013 \u201cto hold the line\u201d. \u201cThe seat\u2019s Muslim population are concentrated in this region, which represents untapped territory for Greens\u2019 gains,\u201d Jacobs said. A Victorian Labor MP also noted Ratnam had a \u201chigh profile\u201d as the leader of the state Greens since 2017 and as a suburban mayor in the area. She previously ran for Wills against Khalil in 2016. A Victorian Labor strategist, however, said it was premature to speculate about the seat without knowing its final makeup, due to an upcoming redistribution. \u201cIf any southern part of the electorate is taken out of the seat, there goes her chances,\u201d they said. \u201cIf they add more south of the Yarra, we\u2019re stuffed.\u201d Ratnam faces Sarah Jefford, a surrogacy lawyer who contested the seat for the Greens at the 2022 election, in the preselection vote, which will be decided by party members.  If Ratnam is endorsed, as is expected, she would have to step down as leader of the party in Victoria. She will also have to resign from parliament altogether when she formally nominates as a candidate, two weeks after an election is called. In the seat of Higgins, the Greens have preselected environmental engineer Angelica di Camillo as their candidate to run against Labor MP Michelle Ananda-Rajah and Liberal candidate Katie Allen. The next federal election is due by the middle of 2025.", "Morning Mail: OJ Simpson dies, locked up children miss schooling, Dutton\u2019s office bill for Rinehart party trip [2024-04-11T20:57:02Z]": "Good morning.

A local resident, Jason Murphy had reported items found in tanbark near a new playground at Donald McLean Reserve in Spotswood to the local council earlier this week. The Hobsons Bay city council, in Melbourne\u2019s west, confirmed the two pieces of material were sent for testing, with results on Wednesday confirming they contained asbestos. The playground has been closed since Tuesday. The council said it was \u201cconducting a thorough inspection of all open space and conservation areas where we have used recycled mulch from this specific supplier\u201d. Murphy, a Yarraville father-of-two, was visiting the park on Monday with his children when he made the discovery.  \u201cI was sitting under a tree near some mulch when I noticed a piece of wood still in it,\u201d he said.  \u201cI just thought, \u2018well that\u2019s weird, I wonder what else is here?\u2019 And then I found crunched-up building material, insulated wire and this white composite material.\u201d    In a statement, the council said it was working with a material hygienist and the state\u2019s Environment Protection Agency to ensure hazardous material was removed. \u201cThe safety of our community is our priority and Council is working with the EPA and the hygienist to inspect other sites using this mulch,\u201d the council said in a statement. \u201cAll playgrounds within Hobsons Bay are regularly inspected by a safety auditor, which also includes new reserves prior to them being opened.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The council said the asbestos material was discovered in a recycled mulch product around mature tree-planting. A \u201cvirgin soft mulch\u201d is also used around the playground. It came after Victoria\u2019s EPA conducted precautionary inspections of commercial mulch producers after asbestos was found in the soil of a Sydney park, which led to more discoveries in New South Wales and Queensland. The agency inspected 59 producers in Victoria, and said on Wednesday no traces of asbestos was found in their garden mulch products.   Related: NSW to double penalties for worst environmental crimes in wake of asbestos crisis    While most producers had good systems and processes to ensure clean mulch, six were required to strengthen their controls to prevent contamination from occurring. Free garden mulch from popular online marketplaces has also come to the attention of the environment watchdog after a resident in Heathmont, in Melbourne\u2019s east, received mulch containing building rubble and asbestos. The EPA said this highlighted why garden mulch should only be obtained from reliable sources where quality checks are enforced. \u201cI urge the community to watch out for anyone offering garden mulch who can\u2019t demonstrate they follow appropriate high standards and quality checks to avoid contamination,\u201d the agency\u2019s director of regulatory services, Duncan Pendrigh, said on Wednesday. Asbestos testing was triggered after fragments of bonded asbestos were detected in Sydney\u2019s Rozelle Parklands. At least 75 sites, including parks and schools, have since been confirmed to be contaminated with traces of the materials. Queensland authorities have identified at least 90 sites for investigation after contaminated mulch was taken from two stockpiles. The EPA has taken legal action against four Victorian individuals or businesses over the mishandling of asbestos in the current financial year. Businesses found guilty of mishandling the material face penalties of up to $2m.", "Death to Smoochy: Robin Williams brings his manic energy to gleefully twisted children\u2019s TV revenge-o-rama [2024-04-02T14:00:01Z]": "High among the underappreciated delights in the career of the great flibbertigibbet Robin Williams is the gleefully twisted 2002 film Death to Smoochy, a blacker-than-black satire of the children\u2019s TV industry that\u2019s never received proper kudos. Time to correct the record: I\u2019ve seen this devilishly sassy and laugh-out-loud film a handful of times and always look forward to another rewatch. Its director, Danny DeVito, and screenwriter, Adam Resnick, take what should be a scrupulously moral and clean industry and apply awfully adult concepts to it, injecting subplots involving revenge and organised crime while commenting on rampant corporatisation and the prioritisation of dollars over ethics.   Related: Robin Williams\u2019s widow: \u2018There were so many misunderstandings about what had happened to him\u2019    The story spirals around two kids\u2019 TV hosts: Williams\u2019 Randolph Smiley AKA \u201cRainbow Randolph\u201d and his replacement, Sheldon Mopes AKA \u201cSmoochy the Rhino\u201d (Edward Norton). We see Randolph on the set of his show, where he bounces around in a preposterously shiny suit and sings a cheesy ditty about how \u201cfriends come in all sizes\u201d.             But away from the cameras this guy is a dirtbag. Randolph accepts a briefcase of cash from parents, who are bribing him to get their \u201clittle booger eater\u201d (his words) on to the set. He\u2019s then arrested by the feds and his show is cancelled, leaving him disgraced and the network badly rattled. These scenes could have occupied an entire first act but DeVito packs them into a few spritzy minutes, indicating a film that won\u2019t take the audience\u2019s attention for granted and smashes forward with a wild pep in its step. At the network, the TV executive Marion Frank Stokes (Jon Stewart) is grilled by his bosses, who instruct him to find somebody \u201csqueaky fucking clean\u201d to avert another PR disaster. Stokes and his producer colleague Nora Wells (Catherine Keener) search hard and arrive somewhere people go to get clean: a rehab clinic where Mopes performs on a regular basis, belting out such lyrics as \u201cOh we\u2019ll get you off that smack oh yes we will!\u201d to an audience of bleary-eyed junkies. Wells, who is erotically drawn to children\u2019s entertainers (yes, this movie\u2019s weird), is sceptical that Mopes is as proper as he seems. But all the signs look good: he\u2019s a vegetarian who crusades against unhealthy foods, delivers episodes with thoroughly wholesome lessons and refuses to bow to pressure to stage large commercial events \u2013 which earns him dangerous enemies. But none more dangerous than \u201cRainbow Fucking Randolph\u201d (his words, again), who declares war against Mopes and desperately attempts to ruin his career via a sensational series of escalating pranks \u2013 a veritable revenge-o-rama. One involves penis-shaped cookies he smuggles on to Smoochy\u2019s set; another a Nazi rally he tricks Mopes into performing at.    The comedy is not for all tastes. I\u2019m not sure what loving this film so much says about me; on the other hand, I\u2019m mystified that others can watch the film and not find it hysterically entertaining. DeVito has directed some fine comedies, including his Roald Dahl adaptation Matilda and the ferocious battle-of-the-sexes film The War of the Roses, but never one sharper or wilier than this.   Related: Matilda: the cake-based torture sticks in the mind \u2013 but this delightful film is worth rewatching    Williams is a wickedly berserk villain who is cranked to 11, 12, 13. He\u2019s brilliantly entertaining as an emotional rollercoaster of a man spinning wildly out of control, injecting the kind of manic energy only Williams could bring. Like a baby, Randolph tumbles between highs and lows, projecting joy and laughter one moment then crushing despair and tears the next. Norton is a perfect foil, playing somebody who is thoroughly and perhaps sanctimoniously decent: the perennial goody two-shoes, with a repertoire of amusingly didactic songs including one with the chorus \u201cMy stepdad\u2019s not mean, he\u2019s just adjusting\u201d. When I think about these characters, which I do perhaps too often, I imagine them dancing and singing together on a gaudily colourful set spinning around in the clouds.

Seaplanes were prominent around the world in the first half of the 20th century, and are a key feature of Australia\u2019s aviation history. The country\u2019s first international airport, Sydney\u2019s Rose Bay, opened in 1938 and served as a base for flights to Europe.   Related: Canberra to Sydney seaplane service under consideration with Lake Burley Griffin test landing    Qantas\u2019s first passenger services to the UK, operated in conjunction with Imperial Airways, departed Rose Bay airport and arrived at Southampton 10 days and 35 refuelling stops later \u2013 much faster than the more than 40 days the journey took by ship at the time. The frequent \u201chopping\u201d along the route made for the nickname the \u201ckangaroo route\u201d which continued to be used for Australia-London flights. Qantas operated flying boats on the route, a distinct category of larger seaplane where the fuselage serves as a ship hull when in the water, as opposed to the often smaller floatplanes that have floats mounted underneath the fuselage, keeping it above water as it lands. The Qantas Empire Aircraft \u2013 as the joint venture was known \u2013 were first class only, carrying up to 14 passengers who could enjoy a promenade cabin, galley, wine cellar and socialising areas.    The second world war marked a key turning point in commercial aviation, largely bringing to a halt the glamorous age for flying boat-based travel. The war brought about the mass proliferation of runways built around the world for military aircraft.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  By the end of the war there were runways in most destinations and propeller and jet engine technology had advanced. Seaplanes \u2013 which were slower, less direct, more susceptible to bad weather and less economical \u2013 struggled to stay competitive. \u201cPeople thought seaplanes weren\u2019t needed any more and that was probably true back then,\u201d says Dan Webster, chief executive officer of Amphibian Aerospace Industries (AAI). The Darwin-based company is among a handful of manufacturers seeking to revive production of seaplanes for a new age in aviation.    There are several startups \u2013 including plans for zero-emission \u201csea gliders\u201d and electric variations on delivery seaplanes in Norway \u2013 as well as existing producers working on various types of seaplanes. AAI is reviving the Albatross G111T \u2013 a flying boat first flown in the late 1940s by the US air force and navy. As an amphibious aircraft it can take off on water and land on a runway, and vice versa. More than 400 were built by the American manufacturer Grumman, but the planes have been out of production for 60 years.  Originally a radial engine aircraft, the new generation will feature turboprop engines. Some owners of Albatrosses have retrofitted turboprop engines, but on an individual basis only. No company can do it en masse, as AAI now owns the certificate to produce the aircraft. The 19m-long fuselage will seat up to 28 passengers as well as crew, or can be fitted out to carry cargo or as a medical aircraft, when the first of the new-age Albatrosses rolls off the production line in about four years.    Wave of new technology Aviation finds itself in the grip of \u201ca dynamic and disruptive phase\u201d, according to Prof Tim Ryley, head of aviation at Griffith University. Commercial airlines are pinning their hopes on sustainable aviation fuel, as well as more efficient aircraft from manufacturers, as ways to meet looming emissions reductions targets as well as save on their fuel bills. Electric aviation is in its infancy. The technology appears most viable initially for smaller planes used for short-haul, regional services. In Australia, Rex Airlines is grappling with the question of how to replace the ageing fleet of Saab 340 aircraft it relies on for regional flights, as they are no longer in production. It has a partnership with the electric plane startup Dovetail, and hopes to run test flights soon. Elsewhere, small electric aircraft are being explored for mail runs in New Zealand. In another nod to aviation\u2019s past, there is a global race to build and fly airships, both for passengers and to haul cargo to hard-to-reach locations, almost nine decades after the Hindenburg disaster.  Interest in seaplanes waned throughout the 20th century, but they never disappeared entirely, especially in harbour cities. Ryley notes that in Vancouver Harbour Air operates scheduled services around the city and Victoria Harbour using smaller float planes.    \u201cThey do high-demand, short trips and it\u2019s commercially viable,\u201d Ryley says, adding that for tourist-oriented seaplane services, customers can expect to pay more because the aircraft are not put to use constantly to maximise returns, as they are in scheduled services. In Sydney, seaplanes still operate out of Rose Bay, where they fly mostly on tourist runs to places such as Palm Beach. This convenience factor is a big part of the revival in interest and race to bring new seaplanes to market, Webster says. Operators of resorts on remote islands, who struggle to convince \u201cweekend travellers\u201d to forfeit almost a day in travelling on multiple planes and boats to reach them, are one such niche market crying out for an amphibious aircraft, Webster says. \u201cFor the people who run island resorts, our aircraft can fly from an international airport and land on the water right at their resort, so it opens up the short-stay market that wouldn\u2019t be possible. \u201cAs the world has grown, and islands are developed around the Pacific and north of Darwin, the equation for seaplanes has changed again.\u201d   Related: \u2018It\u2019s a net zero cargo solution\u2019: could Victoria become home to an airship renaissance?    Webster says the planes could also be used to provide medical care for hard-to-reach areas north of Darwin, including several Indigenous communities. \u201cIt opens up a whole new range of possibilities for treatment centres for casualty evacuation \u2013 we can land on water and come up a boat ramp to park,\u201d he says. \u201cImagine doing a milk run around the Whitsundays, or to islands in Indonesia where most are serviced by very slow ferries or helicopters. This is a game-changer. \u201cThere are also people in New York looking at this sort of thing, wanting to fly these off the Hudson [River] because it\u2019s so tough to get to an airport.\u201d    Webster says flying boats are cost-effective compared with helicopters, which are more expensive and complicated to operate. \u201cThe niche we fill is where there\u2019s water at one end. If there\u2019s not water at one end, we\u2019re probably not the right aircraft,\u201d he says. Ryley also believes seaplanes could find a renewed business case amid the current upheaval of aviation innovation. \u201cThe economics and pricing depends a lot on what the alternatives are,\u201d he says. \u201cParticularly with pressures on space for modern airports, and the need for good road links on each end,\u201d Ryley says. AAI already has several firm orders for aircraft, Webster says. One order has been reported as valued at US$20m, though Webster cannot confirm pricing. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest and it\u2019s growing all the time. When we started a lot of people looked at us like we might have two heads, but now they\u2019re much more interested,\u201d Webster says.", "Biden pledges to defend Philippines from any attack in South China Sea [2024-04-12T00:08:49Z]": "Joe Biden has pledged to defend the Philippines from any attack in the South China Sea, as he hosted the first joint summit with Manila and Tokyo amid growing tensions with Beijing. \u201cThe United States\u2019 defence commitments to Japan and to the Philippines are ironclad,\u201d the US president said on Thursday as he met the Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos and Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida. The summit at the White House comes after repeated confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the disputed waterway that have raised fears of a wider conflict. Biden\u2019s pledge follows a bilateral meeting between Biden and Kishida and the upgrading of their alliance, which also drew strong condemnation from the Chinese government.   Related: Why the rusting wreck of a second world war ship is so important to China    \u201cAny attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels or armed forces in the South China Sea would invoke our mutual defense treaty,\u201d said Biden. The US president made a similar commitment when he hosted the Philippine president at the White House last year. China claims almost the entirety of the South China Sea, brushing aside competing claims from several south-east Asian nations including the Philippines. The so-called \u201cgray-zone\u201d harassment by China has included shining military-grade lasers at the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), firing water cannon at vessels and ramming into Philippine ships running resupply missions near the Second Thomas Shoal, which both Manila and Beijing claim. In 1999, Manila intentionally ran a second world war-era ship aground on the shoal, establishing a permanent military presence there. Beijing accused the Philippines of violating Chinese sovereignty in the South China Sea on Thursday. The foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said China was \u201ccommitted to managing the situation at Ren\u2019ai Jiao with the Philippines through dialogue and consultation\u201d but that the Philippines had refused to tow away the vessel. She said Beijing would \u201callow\u201d the resupply missions if it was given prior notice and the ability to inspect and monitor the process. Mao also accused Manila of ignoring a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d made with the previous president, Rodrigo Duterte, who on Friday told the Chinese state media outlet, the Global Times, that he believed the US was directing the new Philippines government. \u201cWhen I was president of the Philippines, there was no quarrel in the South China Sea, we were able to return to normal (relations),\u201d he told the nationalistic tabloid. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that it\u2019s the US that is giving instructions to the Philippines, telling the current Philippine government not to be afraid (to go for a fight) because the US will support Manila.\u201d Chinese coast guard ships also regularly approach disputed Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands near Taiwan, and the increasing tensions have prompted Biden to boost alliances in the region.   Related: \u2018Risk of miscalculation\u2019 rises in South China Sea as Beijing ramps up aggressive tactics    As they met around a horseshoe-shaped wooden table in the grand East Room of the US presidential residence, the US, Japanese and Philippine leaders hailed the meeting as \u201chistoric.\u201d Without mentioning China by name, they painted their alliance as a bedrock of peace and democracy in the Asia-Pacific region in contrast to authoritarian Beijing. Marcos, seen as closer to Washington than his more China-leaning predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, said they shared an \u201cunwavering commitment to the rules-based international order.\u201d Kishida said that \u201cmulti-layered cooperation is essential\u201d and that \u201ctoday\u2019s meeting will make history.\u201d Biden, 81, also held separate talks with Marcos, 66, the son and namesake of the country\u2019s former dictator. The joint summit came a day after Biden hosted a lavish state visit for Japan\u2019s Kishida during which he unveiled a historic upgrade in defense ties aimed at countering a resurgent China. Directly warning of risks from the rise of China, Kishida said that Japan \u2013 stripped of its right to a military after the second world war \u2013 was determined to do more to share responsibility with its ally the United States. China responded, saying the United States and Japan had \u201csmeared\u201d its reputation during Kishida\u2019s state visit. Beijing foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Washington and Tokyo had \u201cattacked China on Taiwan and maritime issues, grossly interfered in China\u2019s internal affairs, and seriously violated the basic norms governing international relations.\u201d Japan and the Philippines are the latest Asia-Pacific allies to be hosted by Biden, who was joined by Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol at Camp David in August. But Biden has also moved to manage tensions with China, holding a two-hour phone call with President Xi Jinping last week after a face-to-face meeting in San Francisco in November. On Wednesday Biden said the major upgrade in defense ties with Japan was \u201cpurely defensive\u201d and \u201cnot aimed at any one nation or a threat to the region.\u201d With Agence France-Presse and Associated Press", "Middle East crisis: threat of Iranian attack on Israel \u2018still viable\u2019, says White House \u2013 as it happened [2024-04-12T16:48:22Z]": "  5.48pm BST    The day so far    It has just gone 6.46pm in Gaza and 7.46pm in Tel Aviv and Beirut. We will be pausing this blog, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian\u2019s Middle East coverage here. Here is a recap of the latest developments:  The White House warned on Friday that the prospect of an Iranian attack on Israel is \u201cstill a viable threat\u201d. This comes as the US sought to deter Iran with concerted declarations of commitment to Israeli security, but also restricted the movements of its diplomats in Israel over security fears. \u201cWe are in constant communication with our Israeli counterparts about making sure that they can defend themselves against those kinds of attacks,\u201d said John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson. The first trucks carrying food aid have entered Gaza through the newly opened northern crossing point on Thursday, the Israeli military said on Friday. It said the trucks were inspected at the Kerem Shalom crossing point on the border with Egypt before moving north to cross. France on Friday warned its citizens to \u201cimperatively refrain from travel in the coming days to Iran, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian territories\u201d, the foreign minister\u2019s entourage told Agence France-Presse (AFP). France\u2019s foreign minister, St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, at a crisis meeting also asked that family members of French diplomats in Iran be evacuated, and no French civil servants be sent on missions to the listed countries. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said on Friday she had spoken with her Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and urged his nation to \u201cuse its influence in the region to promote stability, not contribute to escalation\u201d. \u201cAustralia is deeply concerned by indications Iran is preparing military action against Israel,\u201d she said in a post on X. \u201cFurther conflict will only add to the devastation in the Middle East.\u201d Wong also called on Iran to push Hamas towards an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and a hostage release. India advised its citizens on Friday against travelling to Iran and Israel until further notice in view of the \u201cprevailing situation in the region\u201d. India\u2019s foreign ministry said its citizens in the two countries should observe \u201cutmost precautions about their safety and restrict their movements to the minimum\u201d. Poland\u2019s government on Friday called the killing of a Polish aid worker by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza \u201cmurder\u201d, and said the case should be brought before an independent court in Israel. W\u0142adys\u0142aw Teofil Bartoszewski, Poland\u2019s deputy foreign minister, said Poland is demanding compensation from Israel over the death of Polish volunteer Damian Sob\u00f3l, 35, who was killed along with six other workers of the World Central Kitchen charity in an Israeli airstrike. Germany will face a fresh call to revoke all arms sales to Israel on Thursday in a lawsuit that puts more pressure on Berlin amid a rising outcry about the scale of deaths and destruction in the war on Gaza. The lawsuit has been issued by four human rights groups on behalf of five named Palestinians who say they are in fear of their lives in Gaza, and are suffering a form of collective punishment by Israel. Residents reported heavy Israeli fire in central Gaza on Friday. Authorities reported dozens of new airstrikes in Gaza\u2019s central region. The Hamas media office said 25 people were taken to hospital in Deir al-Balah city \u201cas a result of an airstrike on a house of the al-Tabatibi family\u201d. Israel\u2019s military said its aircraft had struck more than 60 militant targets in Gaza over the previous day.      Unicef spokesperson Tess Ingram says she was on an aid mission on Tuesday when the UN-marked, armoured Toyota LandCruiser she was in was shot, she told ABC News on Friday. Ingram, an Australian citizen, said the IDF and Hamas were aware of the convoy\u2019s movements as part of the mission, but she did not see the source of the gunfire. \u201cIt appeared to come from the direction of the checkpoint towards civilians who then turned and ran in the other direction,\u201d she said. Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians, including a member of the armed wing of Hamas, near Tubas in the occupied West Bank after a raid on the town earlier in the morning, the Israeli military said. It said Mohammad Omar Daraghmeh, whom it described as the head of Hamas infrastructure in the Tubas area of the Jordan valley, was killed during an exchange of fire with security forces. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa said a Palestinian man was killed by Israeli forces conducting a raid in Al-Fara refugee camp in Tubas. Hamas said it mourned the man\u2019s death but did not claim him as a member. China urged the US to play \u201ca constructive role\u201d in the Middle East on Friday after its top diplomat, Wang Yi, spoke with his US counterpart, Antony Blinken, over the phone. Blinken used the call to ask Beijing to use its influence to dissuade Iran from striking Israel, the US Department of State said. Hundreds of ultra-orthodox men and boys clashed with Israeli police on Thursday evening at a demonstration in Jerusalem against plans to end the community\u2019s sweeping exemption from military service. Thousands of men had arrived, many with young sons in tow, to say prayers and hear speeches under a banner reading \u201cdon\u2019t touch the yeshivot [religious schools]\u201d down the street from a conscription office.      At least 33,634 Palestinians have been killed and 76,214 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, according to the latest figures from the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas. This includes 89 Palestinians who were killed and 120 injured in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Hamas has indicated it does not have 40 captives who are still alive who meet the \u201chumanitarian\u201d criteria for a proposed hostages-for-prisoners ceasefire agreement with Israel. A senior Israeli official confirmed claims made at the weekend by Hamas during talks in Cairo that it does not have 40 hostages in Gaza who meet the exchange criteria. An assessment conducted by a UN team in Khan Younis after the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the area has reported \u201cwidespread destruction\u201d. St\u00e9phane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the UN\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said: \u201cStreet and public spaces in Khan Younis are littered with unexploded ordnance posing a severe risk to civilians, especially for children. Our team found unexploded 1,000-pound bombs lying on the main intersection and inside schools.\u201d A Turkish state television journalist was badly injured and another slightly hurt in Gaza on Friday, the TRT channel said, adding that the team had been targeted by an Israeli strike. \u201cThe vehicle of a team from TRT Arabi [TRT\u2019s Arabic-language channel] that was preparing to broadcast from the Nuseirat camp \u2026 was targeted by an Israeli army strike,\u201d the broadcaster said, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). It called the attack \u201cIsraeli brutality\u201d and said that Sami Shahada, a freelance cameraman, had \u201clost a foot and is currently in surgery\u201d. The UK government\u2019s continued refusal to suspend arms sales to Israel is inconsistent with previous wars and could make it complicit in war crimes, Oxfam has warned. Writing ahead of an open letter that the charity is delivering to ministers, Oxfam said: \u201cThe prime minister and the foreign secretary have repeatedly defended the UK\u2019s decision to continue arms sales. Yet in every previous escalation of violence in Gaza and against Palestinians in the region, the UK has at least revoked some licenses or otherwise suspended arms transfers to Israel.\u201d Scotland\u2019s migration minister has urged the government to expand the number of Palestinian people who can join their family in the UK. In a letter to UK minister Tom Pursglove, Emma Roddick pushed for the Refugee Family Reunion scheme to include \u201cimmediate and extended family, including parents, children over 18, siblings and their children\u201d. The current system allows only for partners and children under 18 to join family in the UK. The NGO Action for Humanity projected slogans calling for a ceasefire on to Tower Bridge in London, alongside the Save the Children charity, on Thursday evening. The projection read: \u201cOver 14,000 children killed in Gaza. What are you waiting for? Stop arming Israel. Ceasefire now.\u201d     Updated at 5.56pm BST     5.27pm BST       Iran reportedly told other Arab countries last week that US bases in the region will be attacked if the US gets involved in any fighting concerning Iran and Israel, Axios first reported. Three US officials told Axios that Iran communicated the message to other Arab nations and views the US as responsible for a previous Israeli attack that killed an Iranian general in Damascus. Iran has thus threatened to attack US bases if the US further involves itself. One US official told Axios:  The Iranian message was we will attack the forces that attack us, so don\u2019t f--k with us and we won\u2019t f--k with you \u2026  In response, the US has reportedly asked Israel to have a say before any attacks are launched against Iran. From Axios:  US officials say the Biden administration asked Israel to notify the US and for the US to have a say before decisions are made about any retaliation by Israel.  Read the full report here.    Updated at 5.33pm BST     4.49pm BST       The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to meet with his war cabinet as the threat of an Iranian attack against Israel looms, BBC reports citing local media reports. The meeting will feature top officials, including the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and top opposition figure Benny Gantz. Here\u2019s more from BBC on how the possibility of an attack from Iran is affecting Israel:  The possibility of an Iranian attack has led to concern and anxiety in Israel. But the government has not issued any new advice to the population on top of existing guidance to stock up on water, food for three days and essential medicine. Israeli radio, however, reported local authorities had been told to prepare for the possibility of an attack, including by assessing the readiness of public shelters.  Information on the attack is still forthcoming, but a US official who spoke to CBS News warned that Iran could launch more than 100 drones as well as dozens of missiles. The attack could be aimed at military targets within Israel.    Updated at 5.06pm BST     4.01pm BST       More on the White House\u2019s warning on the \u201cviable threat\u201d of an impending attack by Iran on Israel:  Reporters pressed John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, on why the US does not release more detailed intelligence as it did in the run up to Russia full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He said the White House was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with the messaging it had put out. But he added: \u201cWhat we are not going to sit back and be comfortable on is knowing exactly what this is going to look like. And that\u2019s why we are working so intensively to make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself. And we have had conversations with others in the region too. Nobody\u2019s sitting back and resting easy on this. It\u2019s a serious threat. We\u2019re taking it seriously and we believe that it\u2019s best for those conversations to happen away from the public eye so that we can make sure Israel is as prepared as possible.\u201d       3.56pm BST       The White House did not release any further details on the \u201cviable threat\u201d of an impending attack by Iran on Israel.  \u201cI can\u2019t speak to what the intelligence picture tells us in terms of the size, scale, scope of what that attack might look like, except to say that we\u2019re taking this seriously,\u201d said John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson. US officials have said that Washington and Tehran have been exchanging messages in recent days, including a message from Iran warning the US to stay out of a Israel-Iran conflict, which elevated the level of alarm in the administration.  Kirby would not go into details about US messaging but said it included emphasis on America\u2019s \u201ciron clad\u201d commitment to Israel\u2019s security, the phrase used by Joe Biden earlier this week. Kirby added: \u201cIt has also been made clear that we will do what we have to do to protect our own people and our own facilities as appropriate. I think I just need to leave it at that.\u201d       3.32pm BST    White House: prospect of attack by Iran on Israel remains 'a viable threat'    John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, has told reporters that the prospect of an Iranian attack on Israel is \u201cstill a viable threat\u201d, after concerted efforts by Israel and the US to deter it.  \u201cWe are in constant communication with our Israeli counterparts about making sure that they can defend themselves against those kinds of attacks,\u201d Kirby said. He confirmed that the head of US Central Command, Gen Erik Kurilla, is in Israel talking with Israeli defence officials, about how Israel can be best prepared.  It is also likely Kurilla is there to influence and moderate any Israeli response. The Biden administration is very concerned about the possibility of out-of-control escalation.    Updated at 4.04pm BST     3.23pm BST    Poland: aid worker's killing in Gaza should be brought before Israeli court    Poland\u2019s government on Friday called the killing of a Polish aid worker by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza \u201cmurder\u201d, and said the case should be brought before an independent court in Israel, the Associated Press is reporting. In an address to parliament, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Teofil Bartoszewski, Poland\u2019s deputy foreign minister, called the 1 April killings of Polish volunteer Damian Sob\u00f3l, 35, and six other works of the World Central Kitchen charity, were \u201cshocking and disturbing\u201d, and said that Poland expects Israel\u2019s \u201cfull cooperation\u201d in the murder investigation opened by Polish prosecutors in Przemy\u015bl, Sob\u00f3l\u2019s hometown.Poland was working with other countries whose citizens were killed in the shelling \u2014 Australia, Britain, Canada and the US \u2014 to jointly press for a detailed investigation into how cars marked as humanitarian convoy could have become targets of repeated shelling by the Israeli army, Bartoszewski said.  The dismissals and disciplinary measures applied to the officers responsible for the killings were \u201cinadequate\u201d, he said, and demanded that the case be tried by an independent court in Israel. He stressed that all international rule of defence were violated by that attack, and that Poland is demanding compensation to Sob\u00f3l\u2019s family.        2.40pm BST       A number of countries have issued statements in recent days as a result of the threats being traded between Iran and Israel after the bombing of an Iranian consular building in Damascus. Here is a round up of what countries, such as France, Australia, the US and Russia, have said and any travel advice they have announced so far:  India advised its citizens on Friday against travelling to Iran and Israel until further notice in view of the \u201cprevailing situation in the region\u201d. India\u2019s foreign ministry said its citizens in the two countries should observe \u201cutmost precautions about their safety and restrict their movements to the minimum\u201d.

According to the report by AFP, Blinken used the call to ask Beijing to use its influence to dissuade Iran from striking Israel, the US Department of State said. US president Joe Biden has vowed that US commitment to defend Israel against Iran was \u201cironclad\u201d as concerns rose in Washington that a \u201csignificant\u201d Iranian strike could happen within days. US and allied officials fear that a strike is imminent and could come in the form of a direct missile launch from Iran, rather than an attack through a proxy like Hezbollah in Lebanon. The US have restricted the movements of its diplomats in Israel over security fears, the embassy said. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, US government employees and their family members are restricted from personal travel\u201d outside the Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Beersheeva areas \u201cuntil further notice\u201d, an embassy notice on Thursday said. The US envoy to the Middle East reportedly called the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and Iraq asking them to deliver a message to Tehran to lower tensions with Israel. The UK prime minister said Iran\u2019s threats of an attack were \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Rishi Sunak\u2019s office said he reaffirmed British support for Tel Aviv\u2019s right to defend itself. Speaking to broadcasters on Thursday, Sunak said: \u201cWe, like the Americans, fully support Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against that.\u201d The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, said on Thursday he had made clear to Amirabdollahian that Iran should not draw the Middle East into a wider conflict. \u201cI am deeply concerned about the potential for miscalculation leading to further violence,\u201d Cameron said on X.     Today I made clear to Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian that Iran must not draw the Middle East into a wider conflict.I am deeply concerned about the potential for miscalculation leading to further violence.Iran should instead work to de-escalate and prevent further attacks.&mdash; David Cameron (@David_Cameron) April 11, 2024    Germany\u2019s foreign minister called her Iranian counterpart to urge \u201cmaximum restraint\u201d to avoid further escalation. German airline Lufthansa extended a suspension of its flights to Tehran. Lufthansa said on Wednesday it had suspended flights to Tehran due to the situation in the Middle East. On Thursday, the airline said this had been extended until probably 13 April. Austrian Airlines said it was still planning to fly on Thursday but was adjusting timings to avoid crew having to disembark for an overnight layover. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry on Thursday advised against travel to the Middle East, especially to Israel, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. Also on Thursday, the Kremlin urged all Middle East countries to show restraint and prevent the region slipping into chaos. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus was a violation of all the principles of international law.        2.10pm BST    Indian foreign ministry advises against travel to Iran and Israel    India advised its citizens on Friday against travelling to Iran and Israel until further notice in view of the \u201cprevailing situation in the region\u201d, reports Reuters. The advisory from the foreign ministry came amid Iran\u2019s threats to retaliate against a suspected Israeli airstrike on its embassy in Syria this month. Countries including the US and Russia have issued similar travel advisories for their staff and citizens in the region. According to Reuters, India\u2019s foreign ministry said its citizens in the two countries should observe \u201cutmost precautions about their safety and restrict their movements to the minimum\u201d.       1.49pm BST       A Turkish state television journalist was badly wounded and another slightly hurt in Gaza on Friday, the TRT channel said, adding that the team had been targeted by an Israeli strike. \u201cThe vehicle of a team from TRT Arabi [TRT\u2019s Arabic-language channel] that was preparing to broadcast from the Nuseirat camp \u2026 was targeted by an Israeli army strike,\u201d the broadcaster said, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cSami Shahada, a freelance cameraman, was badly wounded,\u201d it added. TRT\u2019s chief Zahid Sobaci said Shahada had \u201clost a foot and is currently in surgery\u201d, calling the attack \u201cIsraeli brutality\u201d.

A lawsuit in the German domestic courts will ask judges to urgently direct the government to revoke all arms licences to Israel issued since 7 October, when Hamas launched its attack on Israel. Germany is widely seen as the second largest arms exporter to Israel behind the US, and is certainly a more significant provider of arms than the UK. The lawsuit has been issued by four human rights groups on behalf of five named Palestinians who say they are in fear of their lives in Gaza, and are suffering a form of collective punishment by Israel. The legal action is directed against the Green party-led federal ministry for economic affairs and climate action, the department responsible for export licences under the weapons of war control act.

The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.       12.48pm BST       NGO Action For Humanity has shared some images of the slogans it projected onto Tower Bridge in London alongside the Save The Children charity last night. The projection read:  Over 14,000 children killed in Gaza. What are you waiting for? Stop arming Israel. Ceasefire NOW.       The charity commissioned polling from YouGov, which shows increasing support from the public for stops on exports of arms and parts to the government of Israel. Results showed the percentage of the UK public who think the UK should stop exporting arms or parts to Israel rose from 56% to 62% between 27 March and 7 April.    Updated at 12.50pm BST     12.39pm BST       Residents have reported heavy Israeli fire in central Gaza today, as regional tensions soar after Iran threatened reprisals over a strike in Syria this month that killed two Iranian generals. AFP reports: As ceasefire talks aiming to pause the six-month-old war dragged on, fears that Iran could soon launch an attack on Israel spurred France to recommend its citizens avoid travelling to the region. Mohammed al-Rayes, 61, told AFP that he fled Israeli \u201cair strikes and artillery shelling\u201d in Nuseirat, central Gaza overnight. He said:  It was all fire and destruction, with so many martyrs lying in the street.  Another resident, Laila Nasser, 40, reported \u201cshells and missiles\u201d throughout the night. She vowed to flee to the southernmost city of Rafah, like most of Gaza\u2019s population. She said:  They will do to Nuseirat what they did to Khan Yunis.  Israel last week pulled its troops from the devastated city of Khan Yunis after months of fighting, but officials said they were preparing for operations against Hamas militants in Rafah, near the Egyptian border. Authorities in the Hamas-ruled coastal Palestinian territory on Friday reported dozens of new air strikes in Gaza\u2019s central region. The Hamas media office said 25 people were taken to hospital in Deir al-Balah city \u201cas a result of an air strike on a house of the al-Tabatibi family.\u201d Israel\u2019s military said its aircraft had struck more than 60 militant targets in Gaza over the previous day.       12.23pm BST    Israeli forces kill two Palestinians near Tubas    Israeli forces have shot dead two Palestinians, including a member of the armed wing of Hamas, near Tubas in the occupied West Bank following a raid on the town earlier in the morning, the Israeli military said. It said Mohammad Omar Daraghmeh, whom it described as the head of Hamas infrastructure in the Tubas area of the Jordan valley was killed during an exchange of fire with security forces. It said a number of weapons and military-style equipment, including automatic rifles were found in his vehicle. Hamas confirmed Daraghmeh\u2019s death and his membership of its armed Al Qassem Brigades. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa said another man was killed by Israeli forces conducting a raid in the Al-Fara refugee camp in Tubas. Hamas said it mourned the man\u2019s death but did not claim him as a member. The military said forces carrying out the operation opened fire on Palestinians who threw explosive devices and killed one man it said was attempting to attack them.    Updated at 12.23pm BST     12.19pm BST    Israeli food trucks enter Gaza    The first trucks carrying food aid have entered Gaza through the newly opened northern crossing point on Thursday, the military has said, as Israel stepped up supplies following mounting pressure to ease the humanitarian crisis in the enclave. It said the trucks were inspected at the Kerem Shalom crossing point on the border with Egypt before moving north to cross.  Israel said earlier this month it would re-open the Erez crossing point that was closed since the start of the war with Hamas last October.       12.09pm BST       The UK government\u2019s continued refusal to suspend arms sales to Israel is inconsistent with previous wars and could make it complicit in war crimes, Oxfam has warned. Writing ahead of an open letter that the charity is delivering to ministers, Oxfam said: Despite the fact the government of Israel has killed over 33,000 people, forced three quarters of the population to flee their homes and destroyed vital infrastructure in Gaza, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have repeatedly defended the UK\u2019s decision to continue arms sales.  Yet in every previous escalation of violence in Gaza and against Palestinians in the region, the UK has at least revoked some licenses or otherwise suspended arms transfers to Israel.  In 2014, the UK government reviewed and suspended twelve export licences to Israel following the outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza.  In 2009, licences for naval guns were revoked due to their use against civilians in Gaza in contravention of international humanitarian law.  During escalations in violence in the 1950s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and early 2000s the UK imposed complete arms embargoes on Israel, because of violations of international law.  Aleema Shivji, Oxfam\u2019s chief impact officer, said:  It is illegal, immoral and inconsistent for the UK to continue to sell arms to Israel, when it is clear that UK-made weapons and components are being used in serious violation of international humanitarian law \u2013 and after it imposed restrictions in previous escalations of violence when the scale of death and destruction had been lower. The people of Gaza are facing unprecedented levels of bloodshed, schools and hospitals are being deliberately targeted and starvation is being used as a weapon of war. What more suffering must they endure for the UK Government to act? It must immediately suspend all arms exports \u2013 including parts and components \u2013 or it risks being complicit in war crimes.  For over 20 years, successive UK governments have sought guarantees from the Israeli government not to use any UK-exported weapons in the occupied Palestinian territory. However, Israel has frequently disregarded these conditions, and rather than enforcing them the UK government has chosen to stop imposing any conditions, Oxfam said. Later today, campaigners will hand in an open letter, with nearly 45,000 signatories - and fronted by over 50 high profiles names from celebrities such as Annie Lennox, Brian Cox and Robert Lindsay, to a wide range of CEOs, experts and politicians - urging the foreign secretary, David Cameron, and Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch to end arms sales to Israel. Oxfam is calling for the UK government to immediately suspend the sale of all weapons, parts and components to Israel and to use every diplomatic and economic lever at its disposal to help secure an immediate and permanent ceasefire, to stop the death and destruction, allow more aid in, and to ensure the safe release of hostages.       11.34am BST    France warns its citizens to 'refrain from travel' to Iran, Lebanon, Israel and Palestinian territories    France on Friday warned its citizens to \u201cimperatively refrain from travel in the coming days to Iran, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian territories\u201d, the foreign minister\u2019s entourage told Agence France-Presse (AFP). France\u2019s foreign minister St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 at a crisis meeting also asked that family members of French diplomats in Iran be evacuated, and no French civil servants be sent on missions to the listed countries, reports AFP.

Iran has vowed revenge after Israeli war planes destroyed the Iranian consulate in Damascus, killing at least 11 people, including a senior commander in the al-Quds force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the strike tantamount to an attack on Iranian soil and said Israel \u201cmust be punished, and it shall be\u201d.

Ingram, an Australian citizen, said the IDF and Hamas were aware of the convoy\u2019s movements as part of the mission, but she did not see the source of the gunfire. \u201cIt appeared to come from the direction of the checkpoint towards civilians who then turned and ran in the other direction,\u201d she said. The shooting showed issues surrounding aid coordination have not been resolved since seven humanitarian workers were killed when Israeli drones struck a World Central Kitchen convoy earlier in April, Ingram said. The AP and Reuters report that she remains determined to go back. \u201cI\u2019ll be a bit more nervous \u2026 we know that it\u2019s dangerous here in Gaza, but we\u2019ve just got to keep trying,\u201d she said.       10.18am BST    OCHA say assessment by UN team in Khan Younis found 'widespread destruction' and 'unexploded 1,000 pound bombs'    An assessment conducted by a UN team in Khan Younis after the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the area, has reported \u201cwidespread destruction\u201d. In an update on its website, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) wrote:  Every building they visited \u2013 and most of those they observed \u2013 had been damaged, and paved roads had been reduced to dirt tracks. They inspected a UN warehouse, four medical centres, and eight schools, and all but one had significant damage.\u201d     It said the assessment had been carried out on Wednesday. St\u00e9phane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the UN\u2019s secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said:  Street and public spaces in Khan Younis are littered with unexploded ordnance posing a severe risk to civilians, especially for children. Our team found unexploded 1,000 pound bombs lying on the main intersection and inside schools. Residents who returned to the area, and some who remained during the fighting, told the team about the dire shortages of food and water and the loss of critical health services due to the destruction of the al-Nasser and al-Amal hospital.\u201d     \ud83d\udd3a Homes, schools &amp; hospitals severely damaged\ud83d\udd3a Roads reduced to dirt tracks\ud83d\udd3a Civilians at grave risk of unexploded ordnance\ud83d\udd3a Collapsed servicesYesterday, we carried out an assessment in #Gaza&#39;s Khan Younis where, with @UN partners, we saw profound destruction.More \ud83d\udc47&mdash; OCHA oPt (Palestine) (@ochaopt) April 11, 2024     Updated at 10.23am BST     9.46am BST       China urged the US to play \u201ca constructive role\u201d in the Middle East on Friday after its top diplomat Wang Yi spoke with his US counterpart Antony Blinken over the phone, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). According to the report by AFP, Blinken used the call to ask Beijing to use its influence to dissuade Iran from striking Israel, the US Department of State said. On Friday China confirmed the call had taken place, saying Wang \u201cexpressed China\u2019s strong condemnation of the attack\u201d while emphasising the \u201cinviolable\u201d right to security of diplomatic institutions and the need to respect the sovereignty of Iran and Syria. \u201cChina will continue to play a constructive role in the resolution of the Middle East issue \u2026 and contribute to cooling down the situation,\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning added. \u201cThe US side in particular should play a constructive role.\u201d Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated on Wednesday a promise to retaliate against Israel over the killings of Iranian generals in Syria. Israel has not acknowledged its involvement.  Speaking at a prayer ceremony, Khamenei said the airstrike that demolished Iran\u2019s consulate in Syria earlier this month was \u201cwrongdoing\u201d against a diplomatic post that is considered Iranian territory. \u201cThe evil regime must be punished, and it will be punished,\u201d he said. The US has repeatedly made public appeals for China to do more to address the crisis, including through pressure on Iran, which supports Hamas. Beijing in turn has criticised the US as biased toward Israel. \u201cThis round of escalation is the latest manifestation of the spillover from the Gaza conflict, and it is imperative that the Gaza conflict be put to rest as soon as possible,\u201d Mao said on Friday, adding Beijing was calling for an immediate ceasefire. US president Joe Biden said on Wednesday that US support for Israel\u2019s security was \u201cironclad,\u201d despite his criticism of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s conduct of the war in Gaza.       9.05am BST    Aid \u2018still not reaching Gaza\u2019, as top US official warns famine has started    A promised surge in aid into Gaza that Benjamin Netanyahu promised Joe Biden a week ago has so far failed to materialise, aid workers say, as the US aid chief confirmed that famine is beginning to take hold in parts of the besieged coastal strip. The increase in the number of truck crossing into Gaza claimed by Israel conflicts with UN records and already appears to be faltering.    \u201cThere is a lot less than meets the eye so far,\u201d said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former senior official in the Biden administration, who is now president of the Refugees International aid advocacy organisation. \u201cVery little has actually changed.\u201d One of Netanyahu\u2019s pledges to Biden, to open the Ashdod port north of Gaza as a portal to sea-borne humanitarian aid, has led to no apparent action, according to the Israel N12 channel. N12 reported that none of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Israel\u2019s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (Cogat) nor the Ashdod Port authorities have so far received instructions about opening the facility to shipments bound for Gaza. Israeli officials had been promising their US counterparts for weeks that a crossing point would be opened into northern Gaza where the starvation is the most severe. It would either be at Erez, which was the main border point before the current war, or at a new site, they informed Washington. No decision was made, however, until Wednesday, six days after the Biden-Netanyahu call, when the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said construction had begun on a new crossing. It is not clear how long that construction work will take.

One man was killed when Israeli soldiers opened fire on his vehicle in Tubas, the report said.    Another Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli gunfire when troops raided al-Fara refugee camp near Tubas, the agency reported. The Israeli military did not have an immediate comment on the raid. The area around Tubas in the northern West Bank is a stronghold of Palestinian armed groups and the frequent target of Israeli military incursions. The West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, has seen a surge in violence since early last year, particularly since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in Gaza on 7 October. At least 461 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers across the West Bank since 7 October, according to official Palestinian sources, say AFP.    Updated at 3.11pm BST     8.37am BST    Hamas says it does not have 40 hostages who fit criteria for deal with Israel    The Palestinian militant group Hamas has indicated it does not have 40 captives who are still alive who meet the \u201chumanitarian\u201d criteria for a proposed hostages-for-prisoners ceasefire agreement with Israel. A senior Israeli official confirmed claims made at the weekend by Hamas during talks in Cairo that it does not have 40 hostages in Gaza who meet the exchange criteria. Ceasefire talks have focused on a US-backed proposal of a phased exchange of hostages and prisoners. In the first instance women, children, and elderly or sick people \u2013 including five female Israeli soldiers \u2013 would be exchanged for an estimated 900 Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel, alongside a six-week ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas appears reluctant to make up the numbers for an exchange with surviving male hostages. Reliable information about how many hostages remain alive, who is holding them and where has been hard to come by. The CIA director, William Burns, has presented a new proposal to try to bridge the gaps between the two sides. The US is pressuring Israel to agree to release 900 Palestinian prisoners in the first phase of a three-stage deal as well as allowing the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza.

It drew the biggest crowds seen at an ultra-orthodox rally since before the Covid pandemic, said analyst Israel Cohen.    But although the majority were peaceful, a few hundred metres from the main stage, outside the military building, rows of angry boys pushed against police lines, taunting officers, throwing drinks and sticks, and trying to attack them with protest placards.Some of the youngest looked as if they were under ten, and treated clashes with the police almost like a game, laughing as they tried to race past officers.They carried signs and stickers reading \u201cEither Haredi, or in the army\u201d. The community says young men who go to serve, alongside secular men and women, will lose the religious outlook that is the heart of life at the conservative communities, were the sexes are strictly segregated and smartphones banned.    A young Ultra Orthodox\u00a0holds a sign in Hebrew with the inscription &quot;to Jail and not to the army.\u00a0Thousands\u00a0of Haredi or #UltraOrthodoxJews demonstrate in Jerusalem against\u00a0the\u00a0Israeli army conscription law outside an army recruitment office in Jerusalem: pic.twitter.com/rAhjISYBcb&mdash; Quique Kierszenbaum (@Quique_K) April 11, 2024     \u201cThe message to Israeli society is that there is a large group of people who don\u2019t want to serve in the army,\u201d Manks said. \u201cThe fear is that we will loose our identity, and joining the army will mean loosing our identity.\u201dHe said the meeting aimed to unite Haredis, and protest that a decision affecting over a million Israelis had been made by a court, not by the government. The supreme court ruled at the end of March that a system exempting ultra-Orthodox students at yeshivas from military service was discriminatory. It dates back to Israel\u2019s founding, when only about 400 men were covered; now over one in ten Israelis are Haredim.    Conscription notices have started going out, and the government said it will cut stipends that are vital for religious students. But potential recruits say they would rather go to jail.\u201cWe are the men they are telling (to join the army),\u201d said Moshe, 19, who declined to give his last name. \u201cThere are many men here who have an arrest warrant because of that.\u201d\u201cWe are gathered here to show that we are not afraid of the supreme court decision, we are not afraid of prison.\u201d Like many ultra-Orthodox, he said prayers of yeshiva students protect Israel more than its army.    The issue is a major threat to embattled Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. His coalition government relies on the support of ultra-Orthodox parties who have threatened to leave over the issue, bringing him down.But opposition figures who joined an emergency unity government, including Netanyahu\u2019s biggest rival Benny Gantz, have threatened to leave if the prime minister tries to find a way to once again exempt large numbers of ultra-orthodox Israelis from military service.  Quique Kierszenbaum contributed reporting     Updated at 9.36am BST     8.09am BST       Scotland\u2019s migration minister has urged the government to expand the number of Palestinian people who can join their family in the UK, reports the Press Association. In a letter to UK minister Tom Pursglove, Emma Roddick pushed for the Refugee Family Reunion scheme to include \u201cimmediate and extended family, including parents, children over 18, siblings and their children\u201d. The current system allows only for partners and children under 18 to join family in the UK. Roddick suggested the minister meet with families of people stuck in Gaza and hear their \u201charrowing experiences\u201d. According to the Press Association, Roddick also called for the Home Office to waive the need for biometric data to be collected for Palestinians looking to leave before they arrive in the UK, or to transfer those trying to come here to a site where they can make an application under the current system. Roddick said:  The Scottish government and the Scottish Refugee Council fully support the aims of the Gaza Families Reunited campaign alongside more than 74,000 people who have signed a public petition as well as more than 75 migrants\u2019 rights organisations and law firms across the UK. The campaign calls for a scheme to be opened for relatives of all Palestinians in the UK, not just those with refugee status. This should be open to a wider cohort of immediate and extended family, including parents, children over 18, siblings and their children.\u201d  A spokesperson for the UK government said:   We are working around the clock to get British nationals, who want to leave, out of Gaza. We have a team on the ground in Cairo and at the Rafah crossing providing consular assistance.  We currently have no plans to establish a separate route for Palestinians to come to the UK. However, any dependants of British citizens who need a visa, can apply for one.\u201d  A spokesperson for the Gaza Families Reunited campaign said they were \u201cpleased\u201d Roddick was pushing for action. \u201cWe all have a right to family unity but the UK Government\u2019s reluctance to create a Gaza Family Scheme is endangering the lives of Palestinians in Gaza and keeping families apart,\u201d they added. The campaign said that while the UK government had \u201csignposted to existing routes\u201d in response to calls for family visa schemes for Palestinians from Gaza, these were \u201cextremely limited and simply do not work\u201d. \u201cWe know that at least two people have died while waiting for the Home Office to decide whether they can reunite with their loved ones in the UK. This is unconscionable,\u201d they said. The campaign is calling on the British government to offer a similar scheme to that which was introduced for Ukrainian families:  The British government has previously offered sanctuary to Ukrainian families under the Ukraine Family Scheme. All we are asking is that the same option is afforded to Palestinians seeking protection from bombardment and starvation, who want to reunite with their loved ones.\u201d     Updated at 8.10am BST     7.42am BST    US seeking to deter Iran from strike on Israel, officials say    The US is seeking to deter Iran from carrying out a retaliatory strike against Israel with concerted declarations of commitment to Israeli security, while at the same time trying to prevent the outbreak of a major regional war, officials in Washington have said. US officials still believe that a direct Iranian missile or drone strike is possible within the next few days, in retaliation for the Israeli bombing of an Iranian consular building in Damascus on 1 April, which killed a top Islamic Revolutionary Guards general and six other Guard officers. The developments came as the US restricted the movements of its diplomats in Israel over security fears, the embassy said. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, US government employees and their family members are restricted from personal travel\u201d outside the Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Beersheeva areas \u201cuntil further notice\u201d, an embassy notice on Thursday said. Israel would rely heavily on US-supplied weaponry in any response to an Iranian strike, a point that Benjamin Netanyahu made implicitly on Thursday, by standing in front of American-made F-15 fighters at the Tel Nof airbase in southern Israel to tell reporters: \u201cWhoever harms us, we will harm them.\u201d You can read the full piece by Julian Borger and Patrick Wintour here:   Related: US seeking to deter Iran from strike on Israel, officials say         7.28am BST    Irish taoiseach and Spanish PM to discuss Palestine nation state plan    The new Irish taoiseach is to meet the Spanish prime minister to discuss their joint plan to recognise Palestine as a nation state and their attempts to force the EU to assess Israel\u2019s human rights obligations as a condition of their trade deal with the bloc. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who is due to arrive in Dublin on Friday, is the first foreign premier Simon Harris will meet since his promotion to the office of the taoiseach this week. In the months since the Hamas attacks of 7 October and Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, Spain and Ireland have emerged as the EU\u2019s most pro-Palestinian member states. On Thursday in Brussels, Harris said he had made clear Ireland\u2019s position on the need for an immediate ceasefire, during a meeting with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. He also reiterated its formal request, made with Spain two months ago, to review the Israel-EU association agreement. \u201cI believe the European Union must use all of the levers at its disposal [to protect the Palestinian people],\u201d Harris said. His remarks came as he faced sharp criticism from Israel for not mentioning the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza during his debut speech to the Irish parliament as taoiseach.

This is our latest Guardian live blog on the Israel-Gaza war and the wider Middle East crisis. Israel\u2019s defence minister has said the country will respond directly to any attack on Israel by Iran, as concerns mount of Iranian retaliation over a deadly Israeli strike in Syria. \u201cA direct Iranian attack will require an appropriate Israeli response against Iran,\u201d Yoav Gallant told the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, on Thursday, according to Gallant\u2019s office. Iran has vowed retaliation after Israel destroyed an Iranian consular building in Damascus on 1 April, killing seven Revolutionary Guards including two generals. The US is seeking to deter Iran from carrying out a retaliatory strike with concerted declarations of commitment to Israeli security, while at the same time trying to prevent the outbreak of a major regional war, officials in Washington have said. The US on Thursday restricted the movements of its diplomats in Israel over security fears, the US embassy said, with personal travel outside the Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Beersheeva areas barred \u201cuntil further notice\u201d.    In other key developments:  The US president, Joe Biden, has pledged that Washington\u2019s commitment to defend Israel against Iran is \u201cironclad\u201d, amid rising US concerns that a \u201csignificant\u201d Iranian strike could happen within days. The UK prime minister, meanwhile, said Iran\u2019s threats of an attack were \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Rishi Sunak\u2019s office said he reaffirmed British support for Tel Aviv\u2019s right to defend itself. Germany\u2019s foreign minister called her Iranian counterpart to urge \u201cmaximum restraint\u201d to avoid further escalation. The US envoy to the Middle East reportedly called the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and Iraq asking them to deliver a message to Tehran to lower tensions with Israel. The Kremlin urged all Middle East countries to show restraint and prevent the region slipping into chaos. The top US commander for the Middle East, Gen Erik Kurilla, is in Israel for security talks with Israeli military officials, the Pentagon has said. Iran has signalled to Washington that it will respond to the Israeli attack in a way that aims to avoid major escalation and it will not act hastily, Iranian sources told Reuters. Tehran\u2019s message to Washington was conveyed by Iran\u2019s foreign minister during a visit to Oman, the sources said. A promised surge in aid into Gaza that Benjamin Netanyahu promised Joe Biden a week ago has so far failed to materialise, aid workers say, as the US\u2019s aid chief confirmed that famine was beginning to take hold in parts of the Palestinian territory. The increase in the number of truck crossing into Gaza claimed by Israel conflicts with UN records and already appears to be faltering. Several countries including France and Jordan airdropped about 110 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Gaza, the French president and military said. A video has surfaced of a senior official at Israel\u2019s cyber intelligence agency, Unit 8200, talking last year about the use of machine-learning \u201cmagic powder\u201d to help identify Hamas targets in Gaza. The footage raises questions about the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 recent statement that it \u201cdoes not use an artificial intelligence system that identifies terrorist operatives or tries to predict whether a person is a terrorist\u201d. Israeli forces killed three sons of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in an airstrike in Gaza without consulting senior Israeli commanders or political leaders including Benjamin Netanyahu, according to Israeli media reports. Quoting senior Israeli officials, Walla news agency said on Thursday that neither Netanyahu, the prime minister, nor Yoav Gallant had been told in advance of the strike, which was coordinated by the Israeli military and the Shin Bet intelligence service. Haniyeh said the Israeli attack, which also killed at least two of his grandchildren, would not change Hamas\u2019s demands for a permanent ceasefire and return of displaced Palestinians from their homes in ongoing negotiations mediated by Qatar and the US. \u201cAll our people and all the families of Gaza have paid a heavy price in blood, and I am one of them,\u201d the militant group\u2019s exiled political chief said from his base in Doha, the Qatari capital. The Israeli military confirmed it had targeted Haniyeh\u2019s sons, who it described as \u201cthree Hamas operatives\u201d. The Turkish president offered his condolences in a phone call to Haniyeh, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s office said. At least 33,545 Palestinians have been killed and 76,094 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday. The Hamas-run ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.      Hamas has indicated it does not have 40 captives who are still alive who meet the \u201chumanitarian\u201d criteria for a proposed hostages-for-prisoners ceasefire agreement with Israel. Ceasefire talks in Cairo have focused on a US-backed proposal of a phased exchange of hostages including women, children and elderly or sick people. An Israeli official confirmed claims made by Hamas in Cairo that it does not have 40 hostages in Gaza who meet the exchange criteria. An Israeli minister has said that after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack there is no longer a \u201cmoral\u201d justification to exempt ultra-Orthodox Jewish men from army service, breaking a longstanding taboo within his community. The interior minister, Moshe Arbel, is from the ultra-Orthodox party Shas. Israel\u2019s ruling coalition has been scrambling to find a compromise on drafting the cohort after the country\u2019s top court effectively struck down the decades-old exemption as of 1 April. Joe Biden now understands that Benjamin Netanyahu \u201cplayed\u201d him during the early months of the war in Gaza but \u201cthat ain\u2019t going to happen any more\u201d, according to US senator Tim Kaine. The Democratic party\u2019s leading foreign policy voice told the Guardian that the Israeli prime minister had made Israel \u201cdramatically less safe\u201d and hurt its longstanding relationship with the US. Israeli jets hit military targets of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in the areas of Meiss el Jabal, Yarine and Khiam, as well as a Hezbollah observation post in the area of Marwahin and another compound in Al-Dahira in southern Lebanon, the Israeli military said on Thursday. The US destroyed an anti-ship ballistic missile launched from a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen as well as 11 Houthi drones, the military said on Thursday, after the Iran-backed group claimed it had targeted Israeli and US ships off the Gulf of Aden. US central command said no injuries or damage to vessels were reported. Israel\u2019s foreign ministry denounced Ireland\u2019s new prime minister, Simon Harris, for not mentioning the hostages held by militants in Gaza during a speech to the Irish parliament.

With that jetty in place, Cyprus expects aid to resume soon, Cypriot president Nikos Christodoulides said. \n   Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated on Wednesday a promise to retaliate against Israel over the killings of Iranian generals in Syria. Israel has not acknowledged its involvement. Khamenei spoke at a prayer ceremony, saying the airstrike that demolished Iran\u2019s consulate in Syria earlier this month was \u201cwrongdoing\u201d against a diplomatic post that is considered Iranian territory. \u201cThe evil regime must be punished, and it will be punished,\u201d he said. \n   Israel\u2019s foreign minister threatened on Wednesday that its country\u2019s forces would strike Iran directly if the Islamic Republic launched an attack from its territory against Israel. \u201cIf Iran attacks from its territory, Israel will respond and attack in Iran,\u201d Israel Katz said in a post on X in both Farsi and Hebrew. \n   Israel said it was moving aid into Gaza more quickly in the as a result of international pressure, but the figures have been disputed. Israel said 468 aid trucks were moved into Gaza on Tuesday, the highest since the conflict began. That followed 419 on Monday. But the Red Crescent and UN have given much lower figures, with the UN saying many trucks were only half full because of Israeli inspection rules. \n   US president Joe Biden said Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s approach on Gaza was a \u201cmistake\u201d and urged Israel to call for a ceasefire, in an interview that aired on Tuesday. \u201cI think what he\u2019s doing is a mistake. I don\u2019t agree with his approach,\u201d Biden told Univision, a US Spanish-language TV network, when asked about Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the war. \n   Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez warned on Wednesday that Israel\u2019s \u201cdisproportionate response\u201d in the Gaza war with Hamas risks \u201cdestabilising the Middle East, and as a consequence, the entire world\u201d. S\u00e1nchez also insisted that the recognition of a Palestinian state, long resisted by Israel and its key allies, is \u201cin Europe\u2019s geopolitical interests\u201d. \n   Eid al-Fitr was observed by Muslims across the world on Wednesday, including in Gaza, where Eid prayers were held outside the ruins of a mosque in Rafah to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Some displaced worshippers knelt on plastic tarpaulin outside tents where they are living after Israeli offensives destroyed their homes and infrastructure. \n   The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, confirmed the government will not suspend arms exports to Israel after the killing of seven aid workers in an airstrike on Gaza last week, as he insisted the UK would continue to act within international law. Cameron said that he had reviewed the most recent legal advice about the situation on the ground but this left the UK\u2019s position on export licences \u201cunchanged\u201d. \n   A vigil for the more than 100 people who remain unaccounted for after being kidnapped by Hamas in October took place in central London on Tuesday. The event, which was organised by groups including the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council, was addressed by family members of the hostages and Jewish religious figures. \n   The commander of the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon (Unifil), Aroldo Lazaro, said on Wednesday the danger of escalation on the Lebanon-Israel border was real. \u201cUnifil calls for a return to the cessation of hostilities, and a move towards a permanent ceasefire and a long-term solution to the conflict,\u201d Lazaro said in a statement. \n   Israeli forces kept up combat operations and airstrikes on Gaza on Wednesday, reported AFP, a day after Netanyahu vowed no let up in the campaign to destroy Hamas and bring home the hostages. Netanyahu insisted on that \u201cno force in the world\u201d would stop Israeli troops from entering Gaza\u2019s far-southern city of Rafah which is packed with displaced Palestinians. \n   A residential home was hit overnight by an Israeli airstrike that killed 14 people, mostly women and children, and seriously injured 30 others, Dr Khalil Al-Dikran, the spokesperson of the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital told CNN. \n   Israel has agreed in ceasefire talks in Egypt to concessions about the return of Palestinians to the north of Gaza, but believes Hamas does not want to strike a deal, Israeli officials told Reuters on Wednesday. Two officials with knowledge of the talks told the news agency that under a US proposal for a truce, Israel would allow the return of 150,000 Palestinians to north Gaza with no security checks. In return, they said, Hamas would be required to give a list of female, elderly and sick hostages it still holds alive. Netanyahu\u2019s office declined to comment. \n   According to the UN, 95% of pregnant and breastfeeding women in Gaza are not getting adequate food or nutrition. In a release published by the UN\u2019s Population Fund (UNFPA), that was updated on 2 April, the UN agency warned that about 155,000 pregnant women and new mothers were \u201cstruggling to survive\u201d. It said they were \u201csuffering from hunger and the diseases \u2026 amid life-threatening shortages of food, water and medical care\u201d. \n   At least 33,482 Palestinians have been killed and 76,049 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, according to the latest figures from the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas. It also said 122 Palestinians were killed and 56 injured in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. \n   A Lebanese man under US sanctions for allegedly funnelling money from Iran to Hamas has been killed just outside Beirut, a security source told AFP on Wednesday. The body of Mohammad Sarur was found on Tuesday in a villa in the mountain town of Beit Mery, the source told AFP, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media. \n   Palestine\u2019s ambassador to Ireland on Wednesday welcomed Dublin\u2019s promise to formally recognise Palestinian statehood and hoped other EU members will follow. \u201cI hope that this recognition by Ireland will be a reality soon, and Ireland will lead other EU states to follow suit,\u201d Dr Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid told RT\u00c9 on Wednesday. \u201cIreland has always stood on the right side of history, justice, humanity international law \u2013 so I expected that Ireland will lead in the recognition of the state of Palestine.\u201d Asked if Ireland should have already done so she said: \u201cYes.\u201d \n   Current and former US officials, who have spoken to the BBC, said that the US president\u2019s pressure on Israel after last week\u2019s deadly attack on aid workers did not go far enough. They also said that it would fail to stem the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \n   The Australian foreign minister, Penny Wong, has said a \u201cpathway out of the endless cycle of violence\u201d in the Middle East can only come with recognition of \u201ca Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel\u201d. Some commentators have interpreted the speech as a hint that Australia could recognise Palestinian statehood in the near term, although Wong has clarified that the government has made no such decision. \n   Three people were charged in the UK after a pro-Palestine demonstration outside Labour leader Keir Starmer\u2019s home, the Metropolitan police said on Wednesday. In its statement, the Met said that \u201ctwo women and a man arrested in Kentish Town on Tuesday 9 April have been charged with public order offences and will appear at Westminster magistrates court\u201d. \n   Rishi Sunak defended the UK\u2019s decision not to suspend arms sales to Israel, saying \u201cnone of our closest allies\u201d have stopped existing export licences but added Netanyahu \u201cneeds to do more\u201d to alleviate suffering in Gaza. Sunak made the comments on Wednesday when responding to a caller on his LBC phone-in interview. \n   Oxfam responded to a press conference on the conflict in Gaza, held in New York, where the UK foreign secretary mentioned having a \u2018plan B\u2019 should the conflict escalate into Rafah. \u201cThere is no plan B for more than a million desperate people currently sheltering in Rafah \u2013 if Israel launches a ground offensive, then the scale of the crisis would be catastrophic,\u201d said Oxfam\u2019s chief impact officer, Aleema Shivji. \n   The World Health Organization (WHO) teams arrived at Al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza on Monday to help identify bodies in the ruins. Motasem Salah, director of the Gaza Emergency Operations Centre, told AFP the scenes on Monday at the sprawling medical centre were \u201cunbearable\u201d. Salah said Gaza lacked the forensic experts needed to help identify the dead or determine what had happened to them. So they are relying on \u201cthe expertise of the WHO and OCHA (UN humanitarian office) delegation\u201d, he said. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.25pm BST \n \n \n  2.55pm BST  \n Gaza aid shipments to resume soon, Cyprus says, as 1,000 tons of food await delivery \n  \n  Aid shipments to Gaza are expected to resume soon from Cyprus, officials said on Wednesday, reports Reuters. \n  According to the news agency, Cyprus has about 1,000 tons of aid destined for starving or severely hungry people in Gaza stored on the island. It is being held there after a decision by World Central Kitchen (WCK) to pause and review activity in the territory after the deaths of its workers on 1 April. \n  The US plans to set up a dock, with a target date of 1 May, on Gaza\u2019s Mediterranean coast that will enable aid deliveries which will be pre-screened in Cyprus, with Israeli oversight. With that jetty in place, Cyprus expects aid to resume soon, Cypriot president Nikos Christodoulides said. \n  \u201cWe are in communication with countries we have worked with from the outset, so that very soon humanitarian aid from Cyprus will resume after the completion of the US project in Gaza,\u201d he said. \n  The WCK had been operational in Gaza since October, using land, air and more recently the sea, to get aid in to supply its network of more than 60 community kitchens.  \n  Workers were midway into unloading a second shipment of aid through the Cyprus route when their three-vehicle convoy was hit by Israeli strikes. \n  After WCK announced the pause, a convoy of ships taking part in the mission returned to Cyprus on 3 April 3 with undelivered aid, said Reuters. Initially at anchorage, the ship carrying food was brought to port for offloading after bad weather in Cyprus this week. \n  \u201cThe plan is to store the aid until WCK decides what it wants to do,\u201d a Cypriot official told Reuters. \n  \n \n \n  2.12pm BST  \n UN says that 95% of pregnant and breastfeeding women in Gaza not getting adequate food or nutrition \n  \n  According to the UN, 95% of pregnant and breastfeeding women in Gaza are not getting adequate food or nutrition.  \n   \n   \n    Gaza: 95% of pregnant and breastfeeding women are not getting adequate food or nutrition.Despite challenges, @UNFPA continues delivering life-saving medicines &amp; supplies to women &amp; girls in need. https://t.co/YtIlNneJFE pic.twitter.com/YjveZ6z90E\u2014 United Nations (@UN) April 10, 2024\n    \n   \n  In a release published by the UN\u2019s Population Fund (UNFPA), that was updated on 2 April, the UN agency warned that about 155,000 pregnant women and new mothers were \u201cstruggling to survive\u201d. It said they were \u201csuffering from hunger and the diseases \u2026 amid life-threatening shortages of food, water and medical care\u201d.  \n  At the time of UNFPA\u2019s update, only three maternity hospitals remained in the Gaza Strip, and these were \u201coverwhelmed with patients\u201d, the UN agency said.  \n  \u201cIf women do survive pregnancy and childbirth, they must return to overcrowded shelters and informal settlements that lack clean water and hygiene facilities,\u201d added the UN agency for sexual and reproductive health. \n  \n Updated at 2.13pm BST \n \n \n  1.56pm BST  \n  \n  Current and former US officials, who have spoken to the BBC, say that US president Joe Biden\u2019s pressure on Israel after last week\u2019s deadly attack on aid workers did not go far enough. They also said that it would fail to stem the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \n  A the tougher line by Biden, after seven workers from food charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) were killed by Israeli strikes, was \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d, according to Annelle Sheline, an official working in human rights who quit the state department in protest a fortnight ago. \n  She told the BBC that the White House \u201ccould have done this months ago and prevented famine in northern Gaza\u201d. \n  The BBC report also highlights the views of four current officials at varying levels of seniority in different government departments who spoke to the broadcaster on condition of anonymity. According to the BBC, two of the officials have roles in areas with direct links to foreign policy, including on Israel and Gaza. \n  Tom Bateman, the BBC\u2019s state department correspondent writes:  \n   \n   The officials\u2019 accounts are the latest sign of deepening disquiet and a growing readiness within the ranks of the Biden administration to question the moral and legal basis of US backing for Israel, a bedrock of Washington policy going back decades across administrations.  \n   Some criticised the support as apparently unconditional, citing Washington\u2019s $3.8bn (\u00a33bn) a year package of military assistance to Israel and the potential sale of $18bn worth of F-15 fighter jets.\u201d \n   \n  \n \n \n  1.38pm BST  \n  \n  Israel has agreed in ceasefire talks in Egypt to concessions about the return of Palestinians to the north of Gaza, but believes Hamas does not want to strike a deal, Israeli officials said on Wednesday. \n  Reuters reports that two officials with knowledge of the talks said that under a US proposal for a truce, Israel would allow the return of 150,000 Palestinians to north Gaza with no security checks.  \n  In return, they said, Hamas would be required to give a list of female, elderly and sick hostages it still holds alive. \n  Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office declined to comment, say Reuters. Hamas said on Tuesday that the latest proposal passed on by Eqyptian and Qatari mediators did not meet demands, but that it would study it further before responding. \n  Israel\u2019s assessment is that Hamas does not want to strike a deal yet, the two Israeli officials told the news agency. \n  Hamas wants an end to the Israeli military offensive, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and permission for displaced Palestinians to return home. \n  Israel\u2019s immediate aim is to secure the release of hostages seized by Hamas in its 7 October attack. Israel says it will not end the war until Hamas no longer controls Gaza or threatens Israel militarily. \n  \n \n \n  1.20pm BST  \n 122 Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, says health ministry \n  \n  The latest figures from the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, said 122 Palestinians were killed and 56 injured in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours. \n  According to the statement, at least 33,482 Palestinians have been killed and 76,049 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October. \n  The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. \n  \n \n \n  1.06pm BST  \n  \n  In the UK, three people have been charged after a pro-Palestine demonstration outside Labour leader Keir Starmer\u2019s home, the Metropolitan police have said. \n  On Tuesday demonstrators hung a banner outside Sir Keir\u2019s house that read: \u201cStarmer stop the killing\u201d, surrounded by red hand prints. Protesters then laid rows of children\u2019s shoes in front of the Labour leader\u2019s door to signify children killed in Gaza. \n  The group that carried out the demonstration, known as Youth Demand, describe itself as a \u201cnew youth resistance campaign fighting for an end to genocide\u201d. \n  A Metropolitan police statement said: \u201cTwo women and a man arrested in Kentish Town on Tuesday 9 April have been charged with public order offences and will appear at Westminster magistrates court.\u201d \n  \u201cThis power stops the harassment of a person at their home address if an officer suspects it is causing alarm or distress to the occupant,\u201d the statement added. \n  The three protesters have been charged with public order offences. \n  In a video posted to X, Youth Demand called for a two-way arms embargo on Israel, saying that weapons manufactured in the UK were being \u201cused to cause genocide\u2019\u2019. \n   \n   \n    \ud83d\udea8 BREAKING: Youth Demand Pay @Keir_Starmer a VisitWhilst 12,000 children in Gaza are slaughtered, @UKLabour continue to allow the selling of arms to Israel.

He later denied making these comments, saying: \u201cI was not saying that Isreal had to right to cut off water, food, fuel or medicines.\u201d \n  The UK government has faced increasing pressure to suspend arms export licences to Israel after seven aid workers, including three British nationals, were killed by an Israeli airstrike. \n  Starmer has reiterated calls for the government to publish legal advice it has received on whether Israel is violating international law in Gaza, with the party\u2019s shadow foreign secretary David Lammy stating arms sales should be halted if there has been a \u201cserious breach\u201d of international law. \n  Prime minister Rishi Sunak condemned the protest on social media. He posted to X: \u201cI don\u2019t care what your politics are, no MP should be harassed at their own home.

He said: \u201cOver the past few hours, the situation has been extremely calm on the ground. We have not recorded any military attacks on Gaza. This is considered to be one of the few periods in months that the Strip hasn\u2019t been widely hit by the Israeli army.\u201d \n  Dr. Khalil Al-Dikran, the spokesperson of the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital, told CNN that a residential home was struck overnight by an Israeli airstrike that killed 14 people, mostly women and children, adding that 30 others were seriously injured. \n  \n Updated at 2.43pm BST \n \n \n  12.02pm BST  \n  \n  Here are some of the latest images on the newswires: \n  \n \n \n  11.42am BST  \n  \n  Israeli strikes hit Gaza on Wednesday as Muslims marked the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan and after US president Joe Biden labelled Israel\u2019s approach to the war a \u201cmistake\u201d (see 07:29 BST). \n  AFP reports that Israeli forces kept up combat operations and airstrikes on Gaza on Wednesday, a day after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed no let up in the campaign to destroy Hamas and bring home the hostages. \n  Netanyahu insisted on that \u201cno force in the world\u201d would stop Israeli troops from entering Gaza\u2019s far-southern city of Rafah which is packed with displaced Palestinians. \n  According to AFP, Netanyahu\u2019s threat came amid talks in Cairo involving US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators for a truce and hostage release deal. \n  \n \n \n  11.25am BST  \n Israel's 'disproportionate response' in Gaza risks 'destabilising Middle East and... the entire world', says Spanish PM \n  \n  Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez warned on Wednesday that Israel\u2019s \u201cdisproportionate response\u201d in the Gaza war with Hamas risks \u201cdestabilising the Middle East, and as a consequence, the entire world\u201d, reports AFP. \n  S\u00e1nchez also insisted that the recognition of a Palestinian state, long resisted by Israel and its key allies, is \u201cin Europe\u2019s geopolitical interests\u201d. \n  S\u00e1nchez had already raised the subject of statehood during a visit last week to Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, when he told reporters that Spain could recognise Palestine as a nation by the end of June. \n  \u201cThe international community cannot help the Palestinian state if it does not recognise its existence,\u201d S\u00e1nchez told lawmakers on Wednesday, according to AFP. \n  Since the start of the war in Gaza more than six months ago, the socialist premier has pushed for Europe to accord such recognition.

She does not know if he is dead or alive. \n  According to AFP, the nurse recalled how the Israeli army had quickly surrounded the hospital last month and then used loudspeakers to order that \u201ceveryone must surrender. Game over\u201d. \n  \u201cThen, they started shooting at all the entrances, preventing anyone from moving,\u201d she said. \u201cI spent four days there with my two little daughters, without any food or drink. They cried from hunger. When they arrested my husband, he had not eaten for three days.\u201d \n  AFP asked the Israeli army if they knew of Kali\u2019s whereabouts, but there was no immediate response. \n  The Israeli military have long accused Hamas and Palestinian militants of using hospitals and other medical facilities as hideouts and command posts, and their patients as shields. Hamas have denied this. \n  Motasem Salah, director of the Gaza Emergency Operations Centre, told AFP the scenes on Monday at the sprawling medical centre were \u201cunbearable\u201d. \n  \u201cThe stench of death is everywhere,\u201d he said, as a digger went through the rubble and rescue workers pulled decomposed bodies from the sand and ruins. \n  Salah said Gaza lacked the forensic experts needed to help identify the dead or determine what had happened to them. So they are relying on \u201cthe expertise of the WHO and OCHA (UN humanitarian office) delegation\u201d, he said. \n  They are trying \u201cto identify the decomposed bodies and the body parts that were crushed\u201d from wallets and documents, Salah told AFP. \n  Relatives were also there \u201cto ascertain the fate of their sons, whether they have been killed, are missing, or have been displaced to the south,\u201d said Amjad Aliwa, the head of Al-Shifa\u2019s emergency department. He said they wanted to identify \u201ctheir sons and ensure they receive a proper burial\u201d. \n  \u201cHowever, we lack the necessary equipment, and time is not on our side,\u201d Aliwa told AFP. \u201cWe must complete the job before the bodies decompose.\u201d \n  Salah said the psychological impact of this \u201cunwatchable\u201d process on the families is unbearable, in another WHO video from the scene shared with AFP. \n  \u201cSeeing their children as decomposing corpses and their bodies completely torn apart is a scene that can\u2019t be described.

Israel has not acknowledged its involvement, though it has been bracing for an Iranian response to the attack that was a significant escalation in their long-running shadow war, says the AP.According to the news agency, state TV broadcast Khamenei\u2019s remarks live and he did not elaborate on the way Iran would retaliate.Khamenei also criticised the west, particularly the US and the UK, for supporting Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza.\u201cIt was expected they [would] prevent [Israel] in this disaster.

This must include immediately stopping all arms sales to Israel. \n   It is incomprehensible that the UK is devising a humanitarian plan for an Israeli offensive into Rafah while UK-made arms and components could be used to harm Palestinian civilians in the very same offensive. \n   The UK must do everything in its power to ensure the only plan is for an immediate and permanent ceasefire to end the death and destruction, enable more vital aid gets to those who need it, and secure the release of hostages.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 8.15am BST \n \n \n  7.56am BST  \n  \n  Here are some of the latest images on the newswires: \n  \n \n \n  7.43am BST  \n UK will not suspend arms exports to Israel, David Cameron says \n  \n  David Cameron has confirmed the UK government will not suspend arms exports to Israel after the killing of seven aid workers in an airstrike on Gaza last week, as he insisted the UK would continue to act within international law. \n  The foreign secretary said that he had reviewed the most recent legal advice about the situation on the ground but this left the UK\u2019s position on export licences \u201cunchanged\u201d. \n  But Lord Cameron said ministers had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about humanitarian access in Gaza as he urged Israel to turn its commitments on aid \u201cinto reality\u201d at a joint press conference with his US counterpart, Antony Blinken. \n  Downing Street has come under mounting pressure from senior Tories to suspend weapons exports in light of the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and after the deaths of three Britons in the strike on aid group World Central Kitchen. \n  Cameron said that continuing to allow arms exports put the UK in line with other \u201clike-minded countries\u201d and reiterated that the UK had a robust legal process for assessing those licences. \n  You can read more on this story by the Guardian\u2019s political editor, Pippa Crerar, here: \n   \n    Related: UK will not suspend arms exports to Israel, David Cameron says  \n   \n  \n \n \n  7.41am BST  \n Family members call for release of Gaza hostages at London vigil \n  \n  A vigil for the more than 100 people who remain unaccounted for after being kidnapped by Hamas in October has taken place in central London. \n  Tuesday\u2019s event, which was organised by groups including the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council, was addressed by family members of the hostages and Jewish religious figures. \n  Six months have passed since 1,200 people were killed and about 250 people taken hostage by Hamas, a proscribed terrorist group, on 7 October \u2013 the largest loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust.

This is our latest Guardian live blog on the Israel-Gaza war and the wider Middle East crisis. \n  Israel says it is moving aid into Gaza more quickly in the wake of international pressure, but the figures are being disputed. \n  Israel said 468 aid trucks were moved into Gaza on Tuesday, the highest since the conflict began. That followed 419 on Monday. But the Red Crescent and United Nations have given much lower figures, with the UN saying many trucks were only half full because of Israeli inspection rules, according to Reuters. \n  The US Agency for International Development acknowledged that humanitarian aid into Gaza had risen sharply in the past few days, but said much more was needed. \u201cWe need to go way beyond the 500 trucks,\u201d USAid administrator Samantha Power said. \n  Meanwhile \u2013 Israel also faces a Wednesday deadline to present to the country\u2019s supreme court its measures to increase aid into Gaza, according to Agence France-Presse. \n  Five non-profit groups have taken the state to court, accusing authorities of restricting the entry of relief items and failing to respect their \u201cobligations as an occupying power\u201d. \n  More on that in a moment but first, here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: \n   \n   US president Joe Biden has said prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s approach on Gaza was a \u201cmistake\u201d and urged Israel to call for a ceasefire, in an interview that aired on Tuesday. Biden\u2019s comments were some of his strongest criticism yet of Netanyahu amid growing tensions over the civilian death toll from Israel\u2019s war on Hamas and dire conditions inside Gaza. \n   Hamas has said Israel\u2019s proposal that it received from Qatari and Egyptian mediators did not meet any of the demands of Palestinian factions. But the Palestinian militant group also said on Tuesday it was considering a new framework for a truce proposed during the latest round of negotiations in Cairo. The three-part proposal would halt fighting for six weeks to facilitate an exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israel. \n   Defying international condemnation over the proposal, Netanyahu said a date had been set for an invasion of Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah, without specifying when. Many western countries, including the US, have voiced strong opposition to the proposed Israeli ground invasion as any attack on Rafah is likely to cause many more civilian casualties and worsen an already acute humanitarian crisis across Gaza. Israel says it has a plan to evacuate civilians ahead of its offensive, and Israel\u2019s defence ministry on Monday published a tender seeking a supplier of tents. The Israeli official later confirmed that the tents were part of the Rafah preparations. \n   An in-person meeting of Israeli and US officials on the planned operation in Rafah will take place in a couple of weeks, the White House said on Tuesday, according to the Reuters news agency \n   At least 33,360 Palestinians have been killed and 75,993 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said in a statement. \n   US Defense secretary Lloyd Austin told Congress Tuesday that pressure on Israel to improve humanitarian aid to Gaza appears to be working, but he said more must be done, and it remains to be seen if the improvement will continue. \u201cIt clearly had an effect. We have seen changes in behaviour, and we have seen more humanitarian assistance being pushed into Gaza,\u201d Austin said in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. \u201cHopefully that trend will continue\u201d, reports Associated Press. \n   Israel has, for the first time, used a seaborne missile defence system to shoot down a drone approaching from the Red Sea that had set off sirens in the port city of Eilat, the military said. \u201cOvernight, for the first time ever, an IDF Sa\u2019ar 6-class corvette missile ship successfully intercepted a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) that had approached from the east and had crossed into the area of the Gulf of Eilat,\u201d the military said on Tuesday. \n   Germany has said Israel\u2019s security is at \u201cthe core\u201d of its foreign policy because of the history of the Holocaust, but denied accusations at the UN\u2019s highest court that is aiding genocide in Gaza by arming Israel. Nicaragua has brought a case against Germany at the international court of justice (ICJ). \n   The UN agency for Palestinian refugees must remain \u201cthe backbone of any humanitarian response\u201d for the 2 million people in Gaza if mass starvation is to be avoided, the Unrwa director of planning, Sam Rose, has said. This warning came as Israel was accused of blocking far more convoys carrying food aid within Gaza, where famine is looming, than convoys carrying other kinds of aid. \u201cFood convoys that should be going particularly to the north, where 70 percent of people face famine conditions, are \u2026 three times more likely to be denied than any other humanitarian convoys with other kinds of material,\u201d Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN\u2019s humanitarian agency, told reporters in Geneva. \n   A vigil for the more than 100 people who remain unaccounted for after being kidnapped by Hamas in October has taken place in central London. Tuesday\u2019s event, which was organised by groups including the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council, was addressed by family members of the hostages and Jewish religious figures. \n   Turkey will impose restrictions on the export of products from 54 different categories to Israel until a ceasefire is declared in Gaza, the Turkish trade ministry said. The ministry said the measures would take effect immediately, adding that the restrictions would include iron and steel products and construction equipment, among other things. In response, Israel vowed to take steps against Turkey, accusing it of violating trade deals between the two countries. \n   France\u2019s foreign minister, St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, has suggested that the international community should pressure Israel by potentially imposing sanctions to force it to allow more aid into Gaza. \u201cThere must be levers of influence and there are multiple levers, going up to sanctions to let humanitarian aid cross checkpoints,\u201d he told French outlets RFI radio and France 24. \n   Israeli warplanes struck a Syrian military position overnight Tuesday in response to rocket fire on the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, the military said. The Israeli military said on Tuesday that \u201cwarplanes attacked Syrian army military infrastructure overnight in the Mahajjah area\u201d \u2013 about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the demilitarised zone separating the opposing forces. The Israeli army said it identified a rocket launch from Syrian territory on Monday that caused no casualties. It said artillery struck the source of the fire. \n   \n  \n", "Albanese signals May budget likely to include extension of energy price relief for small business and families [2024-04-03T13:51:24Z]": "Anthony Albanese will give the strongest signal yet that the government will extend energy price relief, as he declares that small businesses and families will be \u201cfront and centre\u201d in the May budget.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  On Thursday Albanese will say that \u201cour government understands that for small business \u2013 as for Australian families \u2013 energy bills remain a source of financial pressure\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s why the energy bill relief package I negotiated with the states and territories delivered up to $650 in savings for around 1 million small businesses, along with 5 million families,\u201d Albanese will say, according to an advance copy of his speech seen by Guardian Australia. \u201cHelping Australian families and small family businesses with their energy bills was a key priority in last year\u2019s budget. \u201cIt helped people under pressure \u2013 and it helped fight inflation. \u201cAnd as we put together next month\u2019s budget, small businesses and families will again be front and centre in our thinking.\u201d Albanese will say small business has \u201cconsistently led the nation in embracing solar power to take control of their bills\u201d, with nearly one in three businesses using rooftop solar. He will say that the figure is a \u201cgreat start\u201d and that the number will rise with \u201cright investments and support and the continuing advances in technology\u201d. He will also deride the opposition\u2019s energy policies, saying Dutton has a \u201cplan to have a plan to build nuclear reactors somewhere up and down the east coast, some time before 2050 at a cost somewhere in the hundreds of billions of dollars\u201d.   Related: Climate-conscious investors put nuclear dead last on list of desirable Australian ventures    Albanese will also take aim at Dutton for his speech to Cosboa, in which \u201che warned you about being \u2018supine\u2019 and \u2018silent\u2019\u201d. \u201cDemanding that you criticise the government more loudly and more often. Trying to drag you into his politics of negativity and conflict.\u201d Albanese will commit to keep working with Cosboa \u201con industrial relations, on energy, right across the economic agenda\u201d, arguing that unlike the Coalition \u201cwe don\u2019t think cooperation is a sign of weakness\u201d. After last week\u2019s commitment of $1bn to manufacture solar panels in Australia, Albanese says Australia needs to \u201cshow the dynamism and drive of small business\u201d to compete and succeed in a competitive global environment. \u201c[We need] the resourcefulness to anticipate change \u2013 and shape it,\u201d he will say. \u201cThe courage to invest in new ideas and new industries, the ambition for our people and our products to win in the world. \u201cThis is what I mean when I talk about a future made in Australia. Investing in our economic self-reliance and lifting our nation up the international value chain.\u201d In addition to energy price relief, Labor has restructured the stage-three tax cuts to benefit low- and middle-income earners. After it raised jobseeker and commonwealth rent assistance in the 2023 budget, the Albanese government is likely to face renewed calls from the economic inclusion advisory committee to further improve the adequacy of those payments.", "Food aid to Gaza \u2018three times more likely\u2019 to be blocked by Israel than other aid, says UN \u2013 as it happened [2024-04-09T13:57:10Z]": "  2.54pm BST    Closing summary     Hamas has said Israel\u2019s proposal that it received from Qatari and Egyptian mediators did not meet any of the demands of Palestinian factions. But the Palestinian militant group also said on Tuesday it was considering a new framework for a truce proposed during the latest round of negotiations in Cairo. The three-part proposal would halt fighting for six weeks to facilitate an exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israel. Defying international condemnation over the proposal, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said a date had been set for an invasion of Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah, without specifying when. Many western countries, including the US, have voiced strong opposition to the proposed Israeli ground invasion as any attack on Rafah is likely to cause many more civilian casualties and worsen an already acute humanitarian crisis across Gaza. Israel says it has a plan to evacuate civilians ahead of its offensive, and Israel\u2019s defence ministry on Monday published a tender seeking a supplier of tents. The Israeli official later confirmed that the tents were part of the Rafah preparations. At least 33,360 Palestinians have been killed and 75,993 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement. Israel has, for the first time, used a seaborne missile defence system to shoot down a drone approaching from the Red Sea that had set off sirens in the port city of Eilat, the military said. \u201cOvernight, for the first time ever, an IDF Sa\u2019ar 6-class corvette missile ship successfully intercepted a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) that had approached from the east and had crossed into the area of the Gulf of Eilat,\u201d the military said on Tuesday. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees must remain \u201cthe backbone of any humanitarian response\u201d for the 2 million people in Gaza if mass starvation is to be avoided, the Unrwa director of planning, Sam Rose, has said. This warning came as Israel was accused of blocking far more convoys carrying food aid within Gaza, where famine is looming, than convoys carrying other kinds of aid. \u201cFood convoys that should be going particularly to the north, where 70 percent of people face famine conditions, are \u2026 three times more likely to be denied than any other humanitarian convoys with other kinds of material,\u201d Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN\u2019s humanitarian agency, told reporters in Geneva. Turkey will impose restrictions on the export of products from 54 different categories to Israel until a ceasefire is declared in Gaza, the Turkish trade ministry said. The ministry said the measures would take effect immediately, adding that the restrictions would include iron and steel products and construction equipment, among other things. In response, Israel vowed to take steps against Turkey, accusing it of violating trade deals between the two countries. France\u2019s foreign minister, St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, has suggested that the international community should pressure Israel by potentially imposing sanctions to force it to allow more aid into Gaza. \u201cThere must be levers of influence and there are multiple levers, going up to sanctions to let humanitarian aid cross checkpoints,\u201d he told French outlets RFI radio and France 24. Israeli warplanes struck a Syrian military position overnight in response to rocket fire on the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, the military said on Tuesday.

Updated at 2.57pm BST     2.47pm BST       The commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards navy said on Tuesday that Israel\u2019s presence in the United Arab Emirates was a threat to Tehran and this \u201cshould not happen\u201d. Reuters reports:  Iran has threatened to retaliate for suspected Israeli airstrikes on its consulate in Syria\u2019s capital last week that killed seven Revolutionary Guards officers including two senior commanders, stoking tensions between the Middle East arch enemies already simmering over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The UAE, situated across the Gulf from Iran, became the most prominent Arab nation to forge diplomatic ties with Israel in 30 years under a U.S.-brokered accord in 2020, though Abu Dhabi also has normal diplomatic and commercial relations with Tehran. \u201cWe know that the Zionists (Israel) were not brought to the UAE for economic purposes but rather for security and military work. This is a threat to us and should not happen,\u201d Revolutionary Guards Navy Cmdr Alireza Tangsiri said, according to Iran\u2019s semi-official Student news agency. Tangsiri added that the Gulf, as well as the Gulf of Oman outside the strait of Hormuz through which a major amount of the world\u2019s seaborne oil passes, were no places for Israelis. He did not indicate whether Iran was considering any action in the region over Israel\u2019s presence. \u201cWe do not get hit without striking back, but we are also not hasty in our retaliation,\u201d Tangsiri said, a few days after a senior adviser to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader warned that Israeli embassies were no longer safe. The UAE\u2019s normalisation with Israel paved the way for several other Arab states to follow suit, breaking a taboo on diplomatic ties without the creation of a Palestinian state.        2.19pm BST    UN: Israel is blocking more food than other aid in Gaza    Israel has been blocking far more convoys carrying food aid within Gaza, where famine is looming, than convoys carrying other kinds of aid, the UN has said. A spokesperson for the UN\u2019s humanitarian agency pointed to statistics from March showing that it was much more difficult to get clearance for delivering food than other aid in the besieged enclave. \u201cFood convoys that should be going particularly to the north, where 70 percent of people face famine conditions, are \u2026 three times more likely to be denied than any other humanitarian convoys with other kinds of material,\u201d Jens Laerke told reporters in Geneva. Laerke also pointed to delays linked to the crossing point opening hours and the fact that Israel has barred Egyptian drivers and trucks from being in the same area at the same time as Palestinian drivers and trucks. \u201cThat means there\u2019s not a smooth handover,\u201d Laerke said. The main problem though was then getting authorisation and assurances that aid distribution can go ahead unimpeded, he said. Israel is facing mounting international pressure to allow more aid into Gaza, which is facing a deepening humanitarian catastrophe. Israel says the main problem is with UN aid distribution within Gaza.    741 humanitarian aid trucks were inspected and transferred to the Gaza Strip over the last 2 days. Only 267 aid trucks were distributed by @UN aid agencies inside Gaza (out of which 146 carried food). The aid is available, distribution is what matters. https://t.co/def8xdYUF1&mdash; COGAT (@cogatonline) April 9, 2024     Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body that manages the flow of aid, wrote on X earlier today that \u201c741 humanitarian aid trucks were inspected and transferred to the Gaza Strip over the last 2 days\u201d. \u201cOnly 267 aid trucks were distributed by UN aid agencies inside Gaza (out of which 146 carried food),\u201d it said. \u201cThe aid is available, distribution is what matters.\u201d       1.50pm BST       Israel says aid is moving into Gaza more quickly after international pressure to increase access, Reuters reports, but the amount is disputed. And the United Nations (UN) says it is still much less than the bare minimum to meet humanitarian needs. Israel said 419 trucks \u2013 the most since the conflict began \u2013 entered on Monday; though the Red Crescent and United Nations gave much lower figures \u2013 with the UN saying many were only half-full because of Israeli inspection rules. Aid agencies have complained Israel is not ensuring enough access for food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies. And the European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has accused the nation of using starvation as a weapon of war. The UN humanitarian agency (OCHA) spokesperson Jens Laerke has also pointed to severe restrictions on delivery of aid inside Gaza itself last month; saying Israel had denied permission for half the convoys it tried sending to the north in March \u2013 with UN aid convoys three times more likely to be refused than any other. The Israeli military department responsible for aid transfers denies it is hindering humanitarian relief into Gaza, saying there is no limit on supplies for civilians and blaming delays on the United Nations, which it says is inefficient.       1.26pm BST       Israel will complete the elimination of Hamas\u2019 brigades, including in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, and nothing will prevent this, Reuters quotes the country\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as saying.  There is no force in the world that will stop us. There are many forces that are trying to do so, but it will not help, since this enemy, after what it did, will never do it again.  Netanyahu has defied international condemnation to say he has set a date for an invasion of Gaza\u2019s southernmost city \u2013 though he did not specify what it would be. Many western countries, including the US, have voiced strong opposition to the proposed Israeli ground invasion as any attack on Rafah is likely to cause many more civilian casualties and worsen an already acute humanitarian crisis across Gaza.       12.56pm BST    Unrwa vital to avert starvation in Gaza, says agency official    The UN agency for Palestinian refugees must remain \u201cthe backbone of any humanitarian response\u201d for the 2 million people in Gaza if mass starvation is to be avoided, the Unrwa director of planning, Sam Rose, has said.

Nicaragua has brought Germany before the ICJ to demand that judges impose emergency measures to stop Berlin from providing Israel with weapons and other assistance. Lawyers for Nicaragua argued that Germany is in breach of the 1948 UN Genocide Convention, set up in the wake of the Holocaust, by furnishing Israel with weapons. In January, the ICJ imposed provisional measures ordering Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and acts of genocide in Gaza.

But aid agencies say that delivery has been severely hampered by a combination of logistical obstacles, damaged roads, a breakdown of public order and lengthy bureaucratic controls imposed by Israel.

Asked if the UK should still be selling arms to Israel, Braverman told LBC: \u201cI don\u2019t think the fact that these tragedies happen is a reason to walk away from Israel, and to stop selling arms to Israel, because of that broader battle that they are engaging with.\u201d Braverman, who was sacked as home secretary by the UK\u2019s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in November, said she supported the convention that legal advice given to the government should be confidential. She said: \u201cI think that the government needs to be able to behave in an environment where legal advice is confidential and privileged.\u201d Her comments come after MPs from all major political parties have called on the UK government to end arms trading with Israel.       9.26am BST    Israel strikes Syria after rocket fire on annexed Golan Heights    Israeli warplanes struck a Syrian military position overnight in response to rocket fire on the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, the military said on Tuesday. The cross-border fire came days after an airstrike blamed on Israel destroyed the Iranian consulate in Damascus, killing senior military commanders and raising regional tensions. The strike follows a marked increase in violence between Israel and Hezbollah on the Israeli-Lebanon boundary since Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack, as well as the resumption of attacks by Iranian-backed militia on US and Israeli positions in Iraq. The Israeli military said on Tuesday that \u201cwarplanes attacked Syrian army military infrastructure overnight in the Mahajjah area\u201d \u2013 about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the demilitarised zone separating the opposing forces. The Israeli army said it identified a rocket launch from Syrian territory on Monday that caused no casualties. It said artillery struck the source of the fire.

Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Monday that a date has been set for an Israeli invasion of Rafah, located on the Egyptian border, without disclosing the specific date. Israeli officials have said that Rafah is Hamas\u2019 last major stronghold in Gaza. An estimated 1.5 million Palestinians \u2013 over half of Gaza\u2019s population \u2013 have taken refuge in the southern city after fleeing Israeli bombardments elsewhere in the territory. Many western countries, including the US, have voiced strong opposition to the proposed Israeli ground invasion as any attack on Rafah is likely to cause many more civilian casualties and worsen an already acute humanitarian crisis across Gaza.The city is also a logistics hub for the distribution of aid through Gaza, where famine looms and one in three children under the age of two in the north are acutely malnourished, according to the UN.Israel has said it has a plan to evacuate civilians ahead of its offensive, and Israel\u2019s defence ministry on Monday published a tender seeking a supplier of tents.The Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the tents were part of the Rafah preparations.      Updated at 9.33am BST     8.45am BST       In the UK, Clinicians for Gaza have published a letter expressing their outrage at the \u201congoing slaughter\u201d of Palestinian people in Gaza and the occupied West Bank by Israel. The letter, which includes signatures from some registrants of the British Psychoanalytic Council, calls for an immediate ceasefire in Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and says that freedom of thought and speech in relation to Palestine and Israel has been strictly policed in Britain over recent years. Here is the letter in full:  We, the undersigned, current or former registrants of the British Psychoanalytic Council, wish to put on record our dismay at the ongoing slaughter and mayhem being inflicted on the people of Gaza and the West Bank. As psychoanalytic practitioners we want to add our voices to those who have spoken out against this violence, especially in light of its apparent genocidal nature. We are uncomfortable with the loud silence of our professional associations in response to these atrocities \u2013 in contrast to the principled and humane statements issued in response to Black Lives Matter and the invasion of Ukraine. Our associations responded in an appropriate manner to the horrific attacks launched by Hamas on 7 October. However, the historical context of occupation and siege, impoverishment and massacre was ignored. This scotomisation underlies international complicity with Israel\u2019s response. We are deeply disturbed by a military campaign that, beside the terrible toll of death and destruction has, according to the UN, rendered Gaza uninhabitable. This has raised concerns about an imminent forced population transfer, and about crimes against humanity as formally defined. We note that the International Court of Justice, in its ruling of 26 January 2024, concluded that there are plausible grounds to believe a genocide is being perpetrated in Gaza, and reminded Israel of its explicit obligations under the Genocide Convention. In the first instance, we call for an immediate ceasefire and negotiations towards a peace aimed at providing justice and security for both the Palestinian and Israeli communities. It is time to end the impunity that has enabled Israel to disregard Palestinian rights. To this end, we urge that the international community and civil society uphold the principles of international law, as contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequent United Nations Conventions, and that these form the basis for collective thought and action. We also express our deep concern at the way in which, over recent years, freedom of thought and speech in relation to Palestine/Israel has been curtailed in this country, and within this profession. We call for freedom to speak and act peacefully without fear of recrimination, harassment or censure. We understand the intensity of emotions that can be released when this subject is broached, but cannot accept that this justifies the suppression of that open and free discussion that is essential if we are to combat fundamentalism and dehumanisation.  \u2022 This post was amended after publication to remove any suggestion that the British Psychoanalytic Council itself was involved in the publication of the letter.    Updated at 4.45pm BST     8.31am BST       Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have called on Israel to halt its war in Gaza and seek a peaceful solution to the conflict in line with UN resolutions.The two countries made the demands in a joint statement on Monday after a meeting between Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Mecca.The two sides called for international efforts \u201cto halt Israeli military operations in Gaza, mitigate humanitarian impact and underscored the imperative for the international community to pressure Israel to cease hostilities, adhere to international law, and facilitate unhindered humanitarian aid access to Gaza,\u201d according to the statement.They also discussed the need for a peace process in accordance with UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative \u201caimed at finding a just and comprehensive solution, for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital\u201d.       8.16am BST       As Palestinians prepared for Wednesday\u2019s Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, those returning to Khan Younis came back to a devastated city left in ruins from intense Israeli bombardment.  Israel said on Sunday it had withdrawn more soldiers from southern Gaza, leaving just one brigade. \u201cI came to see my home, only to find it destroyed and reduced to a pile of rubble,\u201d Umm Ahmad al-Fagawi told AFP after coming back to the city. \u201cI\u2019m shocked by what I saw.

The ministry said the measures would take effect immediately, adding that the restrictions would include iron and steel products and construction equipment, among other things. \u201cThis decision will remain in place until Israel declares a ceasefire immediately and allows adequate and uninterrupted flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza,\u201d the ministry announced on social media. The announcement from Ankara comes after Israel denied Turkey\u2019s request to join airdrops of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza on Monday. Israel did not immediately explain why the request was rejected, with its refusal leading to Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, warning: \u201cThere is no excuse for Israel to block our attempt to drop aid to starving Gazans.\u201d The US started dropping deliveries of aid into Gaza by air in March, with the Netherlands, France, Spain and other countries contributing to the humanitarian effort. Turkey, which has backed steps to have the Israeli leadership tried for genocide at the World Court, has repeatedly called for an immediate ceasefire in the conflict, which, according to the Gaza health ministry, has seen over 33,000 Palestinians killed by Israeli strikes since 7 October.    Updated at 7.49am BST     7.34am BST    Hamas says Israeli ceasefire proposal fails to meet Palestinian demands    Hamas has said Israel\u2019s proposal that it received from Qatari and Egyptian mediators did not meet any of the demands of Palestinian factions. But the Palestinian militant group did also say on Tuesday it was considering a new framework for a truce proposed during the latest round of negotiations in Cairo. The three-part proposal would halt fighting for six weeks to facilitate an exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israel. Saying it \u201cappreciates\u201d the mediators\u2019 efforts, Hamas on Tuesday accused Israel of not responding to any of its demands during the talks. \u201cDespite this, the movement\u2019s leadership is studying the submitted proposal,\u201d Hamas said in a statement. Israel and Hamas sent teams to Egypt on Sunday for talks that included Qatari and Egyptian mediators as well as the CIA director, William Burns. Israel said it was keen to reach a prisoners-for-hostages deal, by which it would free a number of Palestinians jailed in its prisons in return for the hostages in Gaza, but it wasn\u2019t ready to end the military offensive before it invaded Rafah. Hamas wants any agreement to secure an end to Israeli military offensive, get Israeli forces out of Gaza and allow the displaced to return to their homes across the territory.    Updated at 9.29am BST     7.28am BST    Opening summary    Welcome to our latest live news blog on Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and the wider Middle East crisis. Here\u2019s a rundown on the latest news. Hamas says Israel\u2019s proposal it received from Qatari and Egyptian mediators in ceasefire negotiations did not meet any of the demands of Palestinian factions. However, the militant group added in a statement on Tuesday morning that it would study the proposal, which it described as \u201cintransigent\u201d, and deliver its response to the mediators. A Hamas official told Reuters on Monday that the group had rejected the Israeli ceasefire proposal made at talks in Cairo, the Egyptian capital. Meanwhile, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said a date had been set for an invasion of Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah, without specifying when. More on that soon. In other developments:  An Israeli strike on southern Lebanon killed a field commander in the country\u2019s militant Hezbollah group early on Monday, while the UN warned that shelling was spreading and urged a halt to the violence. Hezbollah and the Israeli military have regularly exchanged fire across Lebanon\u2019s southern frontier in parallel with Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. In the US, sixteen more Democrats have signed a letter urging the US president, Joe Biden, to halt weapons transfers to Israel. Nicaragua has called on the UN\u2019s top court to halt German military and other aid to Israel, arguing that Berlin\u2019s support is enabling acts of genocide and breaches of international humanitarian law in the war. Palestinians began returning to the devastated city of Khan Younis on Monday after Israel\u2019s unexpected withdrawal of forces from southern Gaza. Those returning to the city, which has been under a relentless Israeli military assault for the past four months, described scenes of widespread destruction. Israel is yet to provide a satisfactory explanation for the death of seven aid workers last week, the prime minister of Australia, Anthony Albanese, said as it appointed a senior former military official to study Israel\u2019s inquiry into the attack. Israel said on Friday its soldiers mistakenly believed they were attacking Hamas gunmen. Two officers were dismissed and others reprimanded. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Najib Mikati, and the visiting Cypriot president, Nikos Christodoulides, discussed the Syrian refugee crisis on Monday, Beirut said, as Nicosia pushes Lebanese authorities to stem boat departures. The commander of a European Union naval mission in the Red Sea wants to significantly increase its size to better defend against possible attacks by Houthi rebels based in Yemen, as just four warships are patrolling an area twice the size of the 27-nation bloc. The EU mission \u2013 dubbed Aspides, from the Greek for \u201cshield\u201d \u2013 has escorted 68 ships and repelled 11 attacks since it was established less than two months ago. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, left Oman to visit Syria\u2019s capital of Damascus a week after Iran\u2019s consulate there was targeted in a suspected Israeli attack, state media has reported. Iran has vowed to avenge the death of seven of its Revolutionary Guards commanders killed in the attack.       ", "From dance instructors to boilermakers: Labor says non-compete clauses are holding back wages [2024-04-03T14:00:22Z]": "Labor has accused franchise businesses of cartel-like behaviour for agreements not to poach each other\u2019s employees, arguing fast-food workers could earn more if allowed to change jobs more easily. The assistant minister for competition, Andrew Leigh, will give a major speech on Thursday arguing reforms aimed at preventing practices that stop workers changing jobs could help workers win bigger pay rises. The government is launching an issues paper about regulating non-compete clauses, which restrict employees from working for employers in the same industry and location for a period of time. Leigh says that in the US, UK and European Union \u201cagreements between competitors\u201d such as not to poach workers or to suppress their wages are \u201ccartel behaviour, and illegal\u201d, raising questions about whether they should be outlawed in Australia. Non-compete clauses and no-poach agreements could prevent workers winning pay rises of $5,700 or more typically available when employees switch jobs. In an advance copy of his speech to the McKell Institute, Leigh says that non-compete clauses are now affecting a diverse range of employees: from breakdancing instructors to disability support workers and boilermakers.   Related: Fixing Australia\u2019s supermarkets: how to drive competition without wielding a hammer    Leigh explains that non-compete clauses are intended to protect confidential information but are \u201cthe bluntest tool in the shed\u201d for that job. International evidence suggests they are \u201charming job mobility, innovation and wages growth\u201d, he says.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Leigh says that non-compete clauses have become \u201ccommonplace\u201d, with new Australian Bureau of Statistics data finding one in five Australian businesses use them for their employees. Use \u201cwas not limited to upper\u2011level managers or executives but included all workers of varying incomes\u201d, he says. \u201cBusinesses with more than 1,000 employees were twice as likely (40%) to have employees with non\u2011compete clauses than those with fewer than 20 employees. \u201cBig, incumbent businesses can use non-compete clauses and other tools to maintain their market power and prevent their competitors from growing or new startups emerging.\u201d Leigh argues the clauses can have a \u201cchilling\u201d effect, \u201cstopping workers from seeking out a better-paying job or from starting a new business\u201d. Leigh also takes aim at no-poach agreements, which he says \u201care often made in secret and verbally, so workers don\u2019t know they are impacting on their wages and mobility\u201d. \u201cIn a no-poach scenario, two or more businesses agree to not solicit or hire each other\u2019s current or former workers.\u201d Leigh says these agreements are common where employers compete for the same talent, such as in the US tech sector, or in other contexts including franchises in Australia. \u201cMajor franchises such as McDonald\u2019s, Bakers Delight and Domino\u2019s have standard clauses that prevent franchisees from hiring workers in other stores. \u201cExemptions for certain anti-competitive agreements may mean these no-poach agreements don\u2019t fall foul of competition laws.\u201d The issues paper noted that while \u201ccartels are prohibited\u201d by competition law, there are exemptions, including agreements about \u201cremuneration, conditions of employment, hours of work or working conditions of employees\u201d and independent contractors. \u201cConsequently, even if two competitors agree to fix and suppress the wages and other conditions of their workers the [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission], unlike its international counterparts, may not be able to take enforcement action.\u201d The issues paper queried whether to remove the exemption so the \u201ccompetition watchdog has power to address agreements between competitors that seek to suppress wages, but not agreements that seek to increase wages\u201d. It noted that evidence of the impact of no-poach and wage-fixing agreements on wages is \u201cscarce \u2026 due to the secrecy of these arrangements\u201d. But in his speech, Leigh says that research from the e61 Institute had found that \u201cjob switching and the pay increases that come with it are worth $5,700 a year for typical workers\u201d. \u201cIt is worth even more for younger job switchers who can earn on average $7,500 more a year than job stayers.\u201d", "Whether Australia\u2019s budget has a surplus tells us little about the government\u2019s worth \u2013 it\u2019s all on the choices made | Greg Jericho [2024-04-03T14:00:26Z]": "We are now a month away from the 2024-25 budget. And as with all budgets, the choices made matter much more than any big numbers that get the media attention. The first thing to remember about budgets is caring about whether or not the budget is in surplus or deficit is a rather silly endeavour. Firstly, we know that the numbers announced will probably be wrong; they always are:       If the graph does not display click here   Related: Jim Chalmers warns restoring tax cuts to high earners would \u2018smash\u2019 budget by almost $40bn    That\u2019s no big deal, but the error determines a lot of the media and political narrative. If you get more revenue than forecast you look like a genius. If it goes the other way, journalists write that you can\u2019t manage the economy. The treasurer actually did nothing other than swing in their hammock (to quote Paul Keating on Peter Costello) as the world\u2019s economy changed for good or ill. The 2022-23 budget, for example, was first forecast in 2019 to be a surplus of $9bn. By 2021 the forecast was for a deficit of nearly $100bn. Global pandemics tend to screw up forecasts. And those numbers tell us nothing about who was the \u201cbetter economic manager\u201d. In last year\u2019s budget, the forecast was for a surplus of $4bn, but four months later the final outcome revealed it was $22bn.       If the graph does not display click here No policy in those four months changes any numbers. The budget papers state that the extra $18bn came mostly from $12.7bn in better than expected company tax revenue due to \u201csustained elevated commodity prices\u201d. The government boasted the $100bn turnaround from a $77.9bn forecast deficit to a $22.1bn surplus was \u201cthe biggest nominal budget improvement in Australian history\u201d. But it was all due to the improved \u201cparameter variations\u201d \u2013 ie prices of iron ore and gas and economic growth. In effect the $100bn \u201cimprovement\u201d occurred purely because the forecast in the 2022 budget was historically wrong. The 2023-24 budget will likely be in surplus. Currently it\u2019s forecast to be a deficit of $1.1bn, but all that needs to occur is for there to be 0.2% more revenue than is expected and we\u2019d have a surplus. Would you feel better if that happened? Did you feel richer when you heard last year that the budget was $18bn \u201cbetter\u201d than it had been forecast a few months earlier? Budget numbers are great at giving us a monetary count for things but they tell us very little about the economic choices made. Consider a government that is given two choices. The first is to spend $31.4bn over 10 plus years on an inland rail that does not begin or end at a port and is forecast to create only an average of 700 direct jobs a year over 50 years, and in that same period will add just $16bn to our GDP (which is now about $2.6tn). Or it could choose to spend $31.4bn over 10 years building homes for people to live in.   Related: The push against wage rises has begun again \u2013 it\u2019s an argument for Australia\u2019s poorest workers to become poorer | Greg Jericho    The cost to the budget would be the same (and if you planned to sell the homes to people you could suggest there will be a net return and so it could go \u201coff budget\u201d). Right now Barnaby Joyce is displaying surplus levels of chutzpah by suggesting the inland rail project is in danger of becoming a \u201cwhite elephant\u201d. It was always going to be built on a flimsy business case that, as Gabrielle Chan noted, forecast that half of the freight to be carried on the completed rail would be coal. Hardly a \u201cfuture proof\u201d commodity. Anthony Albanese in 2018 suggested rather presciently that \u201ca future government will have to deal with this\u201d. It also has to deal with the choice of where to direct the resources of the economy, and a budget surplus or deficit will likely tell us very little. As Alan Kohler recently noted, the economy is so near capacity that approving new fossil fuel projects actually limits the ability to build homes, or productive infrastructure because there are not enough construction workers to go round. Want to build homes and improve home ownership rates for young Australians? An easy first start is to stop approving new construction worker-greedy mines. But mine approvals are not in the budget. What is in the budget though is the money spent on Aukus. All the engineers and technicians (some of our best and brightest) who might be on that project are unable to use any knowledge gained on other projects (the US military very closely guards its IP) and thus there will be no spin-off economic benefits nor productivity gains. And because those engineers and workers could have worked on projects that would improve our economic capacity, the economic opportunity cost of Aukus is almost guaranteed to be much greater than any perceived benefit. Governments make choices about revenue as well. Consider that in 2022 the Russian invasion of Ukraine produced extreme profits for Australian gas companies. And yet because how we choose to tax these super profits, PRRT contributes less to revenue than during the 2000s.       If the graph does not display click here If the government chose to raise more revenue from gas super profits they could either raise less from other sources, or spend more on services and projects without changing one dollar of the budget balance. It\u2019s all about choices. Do you choose to direct the recourses of the economy on things that produce good outcomes for Australians, or do you spend $4.6bn to improve the UK economy? Albanese in 2018 also noted that \u201cbudgets should be about real investment and real expenditure and real commitments and real rail lines and real roads\u201d. One might also say real houses, real cost-of-living relief, real assistance for those in poverty, real investment in education and health. While whether or not we have a budget surplus tells us little about the worth of a government, what they spend money on and who and what they tax, does. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work", "How will Sam Mostyn\u2019s career-long advocacy shape her role as governor general?

She has been a board member or chair of some of the country\u2019s most recognisable companies and nonprofits, including Transurban, Virgin Australia, Citibank Australia, Beyond Blue and the AFL, where she was the first female commissioner. She also worked for several Labor ministers, including the former prime minister Paul Keating. In 2021, Mostyn was appointed an officer of the Order of Australia for distinguished service to business, the community and women. Another gender equality advocate, the businesswoman Wendy McCarthy, who has known Mostyn since she was at university, said the incoming governor general first learned the value of public service through her father\u2019s career. Mostyn was born into an army family and lived wherever her father\u2019s service took her parents and three younger sisters: from the United States and Canada to Adelaide, Melbourne and then eventually back to Canberra. McCarthy said Mostyn took that experience and applied it to every aspect of her working life. \u201cShe\u2019s also a lifelong learner,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cShe\u2019s capable of removing the scales from her eyes when she\u2019s got the facts and a lot of people aren\u2019t, they still hang on to past prejudices. \u201cShe does have that capacity, which I think is not only endearing, I think it shows high integrity.\u201d While Mostyn\u2019s appointment was welcomed by both sides of politics, the rightwing lobby group Advance was among those that criticised Mostyn\u2019s support for the voice referendum and previous references to Australia Day as \u201cInvasion Day\u201d in now deleted social media posts. Separately, she has also expressed support for a republic. Some of Mostyn\u2019s contemporaries suggested she wouldn\u2019t waver in her strongly held beliefs and will use her experience and convictions to guide her. \u201cShe certainly doesn\u2019t shy away from things when they\u2019re difficult,\u201d Georgie Dent, the executive director of The Parenthood, said.

Repeatedly asked about the incident in the outback town of Bourke over subsequent days, police media refused to officially confirm the ages of the alleged offenders despite two metropolitan mastheads quoting separate officers referring to a five-year-old.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Guardian Australia understands the assertion that one of the alleged offenders was five was based on an eyewitness account, which responding officers held confidence in. News of the alleged incident was splashed across the Daily Telegraph on Saturday under a headline declaring the child the \u201cmost wanted five-year-old\u201d. The child was also described as a \u201ckindergarten crim\u201d. The Sydney Morning Herald reported the incident as part of a story on regional crime concerns, quoting an officer who said: \u201cIn Bourke in the early hours of Saturday morning, we had a five-year-old child with two 12-year-old children breaking into a property and stealing a car.   Related: Influential NSW independent speaks out against laws that make it harder for young people to get bail    \u201cI\u2019ve never in 30 years of the police service seen anything like that.\u201d Later on Saturday, police released a statement saying that four people reportedly broke into a home in Bourke about 2am on Friday 22 March. \u201cThey (the occupants) awoke to find their Mitsubishi Outlander was being stolen from outside the home and police were notified,\u201d a police spokesperson said. The Mitsubishi was later seen driving on Weir Road and \u201ca pursuit was initiated before being terminated shortly after due to safety concerns\u201d. Officers found the car about 10.50am and it was seized for forensic examination, the spokesperson said. \u201cNo arrests have been made and inquiries continue into the incident.\u201d On Monday, a police spokesperson said: \u201cThe investigation is ongoing and while inquiries are still being conducted, we are unable to speculate to the ages of the people involved.\u201d On Tuesday, police were yet to speak with the four alleged offenders and had not laid charges. The chief executive of the Aboriginal Legal Service, Karly Warner, said there were \u201cvery serious questions\u201d to answer about the origin and intent of the briefings to media, and called for an independent, external investigation. \u201cThese stories are fuelling fear while doing nothing to make our communities safer,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead they are inciting panic about children who are probably too young to tie their shoelaces, let alone be capable of crime \u2013 cognitively, physically or legally. \u201cWe all deserve answers as to why [the police] are doing this, under whose direction, and at what cost to children in NSW.\u201d NSW independent MP Roy Butler, whose electorate encompasses Bourke, said on Wednesday \u201cthere is a trickle-down effect of clickbait journalism on regional and rural communities\u201d. \u201cI understand that media reporting requires catchy headlines \u2026 but what flashy headlines can often do is create a bias,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIn the case of regional crime, our bush towns will be stereotyped as \u2018bad\u2019. \u201cWe do have a serious crime problem in some Barwon communities, and what is needed is intervention to divert these young people towards more pro-social behaviour. Not tabloid journalism. We all have a role to play in changing the culture that these kids are growing up in, including the media.\u201d Two weeks ago the government passed legislation making it harder for teenagers to get bail and criminalising \u201cposting and boasting\u201d about criminal offences on social media. The laws were condemned by reform advocates who said the changes would push the state further from its Closing the Gap targets.

Asked about the criticisms of the bail law changes, Minns said the government was committed to doing more on diversion programs for adolescents in regional communities. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that if we get that balance right, we can reduce the rate of reoffending,\u201d he said. \u201cMy great fear is that we\u2019ll see a young person commit an offence, particularly in a motor vehicle, where they kill themselves or their family members or their friends or they kill a member of the public. \u201cThat would be absolutely terrible. I don\u2019t want that to happen and I genuinely don\u2019t believe that\u2019s in the interest of the young person either.\u201d Greens justice spokesperson Sue Higginson said the government\u2019s \u201cchoice to go down this regressive \u2026 law and order tough on crime road\u201d was creating panic. \u201cIt leads to police exercising impunity and pushing out unchecked sensationalist media which results in dangerous and unhelpful headlines,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we genuinely want to deal with youth crime and criminal behaviour we need to follow the evidence and deal with the causes of crime and the failure of social support services within our communities that should be supporting offenders, not throwing kids in prison.\u201d", "Eric Abetz handed senior Tasmanian cabinet roles \u2013 as it happened [2024-04-10T08:04:39Z]": " \n  8.45am BST  \n What we learned: Wednesday 10 April \n  \n  We\u2019re going to leave it here for the day.

He told Sydney radio 2GB today: \n   \n   We don\u2019t have many levers we can pull which can lead to a quick return of housing stock to the rental market. \n   \n  About 63,000 properties \u2013 almost equal to the total number of homes built in NSW every two years \u2013 were sitting vacant, Mookhey said. \n  Under existing arrangements, most foreign buyers are subject to an 8% surcharge on residential property purchases. Mookhey said that number hasn\u2019t change since 2017 but \u201cI think the market conditions have clearly changed.\u201d \n  A tax hike in line with Ontario in Canada, where foreign investors are charged an extra 25% on top of the property purchase price, is one option being considered ahead of the June budget. \n  \n \n \n  5.16am BST  \n  \n  Commercial TV lobby responds to prominence legislation \n  The commercial TV lobby says a senate committee report \u201cmisses the mark\u201d by not applying the new requirements for prominence of free-to-air channels to existing sets in the market. \n  Only manufacturers of new smart TVs will have to prominently display Australian TV channels to ensure local networks are not crowded out by streamers, a senate committee has recommended. \n  The so-called prominence legislation has been designed to guarantee local, free-to-air TV services Seven, Nine, Ten, SBS and the ABC are easy for Australian audiences to find on smart TVs.  \n  Free TV said in response to the report: \n   \n   If we don\u2019t make this important change, the legislation will not make any meaningful difference until late this decade. \n   \n  Free TV said the committee has also failed in ensuring television sport remains free for all Australians. \n  The networks want the legislation amended to stop paid streaming services buying up exclusive digital rights and putting sports behind a paywall. \n  Foxtel, which is 65% owned by News Corp, is opposed to the legislation, arguing it restricts consumer choice and could distort the market in favour of broadcasters. \n  \n \n \n  5.11am BST  \n Tasmanian Liberals secure deal with Jacqui Lambie Network to form government \n  \n  Tasmanian premier Jeremy Rockliff said he has reached an agreement with the Jacqui Lambie Network (JLN) to form government. \n  In a statement, Rockliff said three new members of the JLN \u2013 Miriam Beswick, Andrew Jenner, and Rebekah Pentland \u2013 have agreed to provide confidence to his government \u201con all confidence and censure votes, guarantee supply to support all appropriation and revenue bills, and support the government on parliamentary motions that bind the government.\u201d \n   \n   All parties have entered into this agreement with goodwill and trust, and I am confident that this agreement will provide the long-term certainty and stability the Tasmanian people expect \u2026 \n   I thank the JLN for their productive and collaborative approach that they have taken as we have worked towards an agreement. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.32am BST \n \n \n  5.07am BST  \n  \n  Former Channel 7 Sunrise reporter Nathan Templeton dies \n  Former Sunrise reporter Nathan Templeton has died after suffering a medical episode while on a dog walk in Victoria, the network has reported. \n  In a post to Facebook, Sunrise said: \n   \n   The tragic news of Nathan\u2019s passing has left us all at Sunrise and Seven profoundly saddened. \n   Nathan was a respected journalist whose passion for storytelling was evident in all his years reporting for Sunrise and several Olympic Games. \n   Our deepest condolences go out to his family, loved ones and especially his two young sons, during this difficult time. \n   \n  As 7News reports, Templeton joined its Melbourne team in 2012 as a sports reporter and then became the Melbourne correspondent for Sunrise in 2016.

It says three small samples were removed. The EPA has advised the council to inspect the site and confirm no other contamination is present.  \n  The EPA is also inspecting a new site, RJ Long Reserve in Williamstown North, after receiving a report from a member of the public on Tuesday.  \n  \n \n \n  4.52am BST  \n New home starts sink to 11-year low: Master Builders Australia \n  \n  The latest building activity data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows there is \u201cstill a long way to go before Australia overcomes the housing crisis\u201d, Master Builders Australia says. \n  The group\u2019s chief economist, Shane Garrett, said work started on just 163,285 new homes during 2023, a 10.5% reduction on the previous year. \n  He added that detached house starts dropped by 16.4% to 99,443 \u2013 the lowest in a decade. And a total of 62,720 higher density homes were commenced during 2023 overall, \u201cthe worst performance in 12 years\u201d. \n   \n   The mismatch between the supply of new homes to the rental market and demand for rental accommodation is particularly worrying. Rental inflation continues to accelerate at a time when price pressures across the rest of the economy have been abating. \n   \n  Chief executive, Denita Wawn, said today\u2019s result means that 934,400 new homes have been started across Australia over the past five years. \n   \n   Since 2019 we have seen the cost of home building increase by 40%. Governments need to work to change this. The cost of delivering projects needs to go down and the time to completion must be shortened. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.39am BST \n \n \n  4.40am BST  \n  \n  Chalmers yet to \u2018hear a whisper\u2019 from Coalition over proposed merger changes \n  As you may have seen, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has unveiled extensive changes he wants to make to mergers policies, as reported here by Paul Karp. \n  The government is touting the changes as the most significant in half a century, although we will have to see how many of the proposals get through parliament and also how consultation led by the ACCC, hones the final result. \n  We\u2019ll have more to say in a separate piece shortly about a couple of the changes now that we\u2019ve had a chance to hear from both Chalmers and ACCC chief, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, in speeches earlier today in Sydney at the Museum of Contemporary Art. \n  But Chalmers did highlight to us a silence from the Coalition, including shadow treasurer Angus Taylor. Chalmers: \n   \n   We have not heard a whisper from the Coalition today. We flagged this change at the beginning of the week. It\u2019s now Wednesday. We have offered a briefing and we expect them to take that up. \n   \n  Chalmers has a theory why they\u2019ve largely remained stumm so far: \n   \n   The main reason why they\u2019re talking about everything except for competition policy and economic reform today is because they would rather stoke division in our community than stoke competition in our economy. \n   \n  We did, though, check in with Taylor, and got this response: \n   \n   None of this will restore the collapse in Australians\u2019 standard of living. This is a treasurer who is all spin and no substance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important the government doesn\u2019t confuse competition policy with competitiveness of the economy. Labor\u2019s policies on energy, [industrial relations] and tax are making Australia a less attractive place to do business. \n   We will scrutinise this to make sure this policy gets the balance right. \n   \n  We assume Taylor will take up the offer for a briefing \u2013 though we haven\u2019t had that confirmed. \n  \n Updated at 4.48am BST \n \n \n  4.36am BST  \n  \n  AFL suspends Jeremy Finlayson for three matches over homophobic slur \n  Jeremy Finlayson has accepted a sanction from the AFL for using a homophobic slur during Friday night\u2019s game against Essendon, which means the Port Adelaide forward will miss three matches and undertake an education program. \n  The 28-year-old used the offensive term towards an opponent in the match against the Bombers \u2013 won easily by the Power \u2013 telling club staff during the third-quarter break and apologising to the Essendon player after the match. \n  Continue reading: \n   \n    Related: AFL suspends Jeremy Finlayson for three matches over homophobic slur  \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.43am BST \n \n \n  4.35am BST  \n  \n  And with that, Jeff Dimery\u2019s appearance at the national press club has wrapped up \u2013 after he saved himself from a near-slip after walking from the podium! \n  \n \n \n  4.31am BST  \n  \n  Jeff Dimery also commented on how confident he is in the target of net zero by 2050: \n   \n   If I steal the line of others in the industry, and some commentators: this transition has been described as akin to a post-war reconstruction effort, and it is true\u2026. It is a monumental task and I am not hearing anybody downplay the magnitude of that.  \n   Does that mean we won\u2019t get there? I think it is challenging, as I said. Would I stand here today in 2024 looking out to 2050 and tell you something can\u2019t be done? No, I wouldn\u2019t. But I can tell you that absent some significant changes along the way, we will struggle. \n   \n  \n \n \n  4.29am BST  \n  \n  At the press club, Jeff Dimery has been taking more questions around nuclear energy. \n  Moderator Jane Norman notes the full details of Coalition policy is not yet known, but reporting suggests they are seeking to replace existing coal-fired power stations with nuclear. \n  As a company that owns a coal-fired power station, does Dimery believe nuclear reactors could be built quickly enough to replace the capacity of outgoing coal-fired power stations? \n  He responds: \n   \n   From a replacement timeframe point of view, as I pointed out I am 55, if you add 10 years, that will get us to 2034, and there will still be coal in the market in 2034. AGL\u2019s timetable is 2035, and [even AEMO is saying] there will be coal in 2038.  \n   It\u2019s not something we have turned our mind to but based on what I have read, could you, if you started now, have nuclear in the market by 2035 or 2038? The answer would be yes. But again, no-one is starting now because the legislation isn\u2019t conducive to us even exploring that. Again, it is kind of like looking for unicorns in the garden. \n   \n  \n \n \n  4.23am BST  \n  \n  Several staff members stood aside at Australian College of Nursing pending investigation \n  Several staff members have stood aside from their roles at The Australian College of Nursing pending an investigation into \u201cpotential financial irregularities\u201d at the college. \n  The ABC has named those staff members as ACN\u2019s high-profile CEO Kylie Ward, along with COO Neil Haynes and national partnerships director Karoline Dawe. \n  The board of the ACN said there was currently insufficient evidence to determine the nature of the potential irregularities, but believed they should be investigated by third-party legal and forensic financial experts. \n  The board said in a statement: \n   \n   No conclusions should be drawn at this time. \n   To ensure due process is followed and to assist an efficient investigation, it is appropriate that certain staff members have stepped aside pending the outcome of the investigation. The Board stresses that this is an investigation only and is not at this stage alleging that any of the people who have stepped aside are responsible for any financial irregularities. \n   \n  The Australian College of Nursing is a not-for-profit body with 150,000 that supports continuing education, advocacy and training for nurses across the country. In the last financial year, the revenue of the college was $22.9m, according to the latest financial report. \n  Ward, Haynes and Dawe were contacted for comment. \n  \n \n \n  4.22am BST  \n  \n  Q: The consensus on renewables is slightly more together, but again we are seeing a lack of bipartisan support for what Australia\u2019s energy future looks like. How much is that holding back renewable investment for Australia? \n  Jeff Dimery said one pleasing factor is that both major parties are committed to net zero by 2050, with the concept of \u201cclimate deniers hopefully [now] off the table\u201d and the debate shifting to what is the best way to achieve this shared goal. \n   \n   Clearly the Liberal-National Party looking at the replacement of baseload coal, with baseload nuclear [while] the current government is more focused around the technologies that are there today.  \n   Minister [for climate change Chris] Bowen has a very very difficult job as does the head of AEMO, and you will see the changes in the composition of the energy mix year on year, as these ISPs are released, and so the best we can do right now from my perspective is keep ploughing on with what we know and what we have got.  \n   We are all on the same page, that is an outcome we are shooting for. The big debate is about how quickly we get there. What would you pay to be there a day early, and what would you be prepared to save to be there a day late? That is really what we are talking about now. And that is very refreshing from where we were, four or five years ago, where we were not even on the same page. \n   \n  \n \n \n  4.15am BST  \n  \n  \u2018Nuclear a political question politicians need to resolve\u2019, energy boss says \n  Taking questions from reporters, Jeff Dimery is asked about the federal opposition\u2019s position on nuclear energy. \n  Specifically, he was whether there would be community acceptance of nuclear reactors in the La Trobe Valley, where he works. \n  Dimery responded: \n   \n   The short answer is I\u2019m not sure, we have not polled them. We care very much about our workers and our workforce and I think it\u2019s incumbent upon us and upon governments to make sure we have a just transition plan for when we do close. \n   The broader issue of nuclear: it\u2019s a question we are getting a bit more lately. My view is nuclear is a political question, and it\u2019s something the folks up on the hill really need to resolve. \n   And what I mean is I am 55 years old. The ability to develop nuclear in this country is not legislated, it is not legal at this point, and I would imagine there is a lengthy process to go through to get it to that point.  \n   Then there is a lengthy process to go through with development and construction, in which time I will be retired. So it\u2019s probably for the younger folks to debate [but what] I would say, you can imagine our shareholder and board would not be too impressed of the management team if it were sitting around contemplating building power stations that are not legal, it would not be a great use of our time. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.23am BST \n \n \n  4.07am BST  \n  \n  Australians will have to \u2018pay more for energy in future\u2019 as part of renewables transition, says Alinta Energy CEO \n  Back at the National Press Club, Alinta Energy CEO Jeff Dimery argues a hard truth of the transition to renewables means \u201cAustralians also have to pay more for energy in the future\u201d. \n   \n   We will spend more as a percentage of GDP on energy, energy services, and energy infrastructure. Whether we pay through the tax base, or pay the large upfront cost of an EV, or batteries and solar, or we\u2019re paying more for electricity from the grid, we will all pay more in aggregate. We need to be honest about that. I don\u2019t think the average Australian is prepared for that reality.  \n   Capital costs more. Labour costs more. Transmission costs are rising. There are going to be alternatives. Electricity might cost more, but your petrol bill might disappear. If we\u2019re prepared to change behaviour and use most of our energy within certain windows, you will be able to have greater bill control.

Asked specifically whether he was willing to recognise a Palestinian state while Hamas was still in control in Gaza, Albanese fell back on the process line that \u201cwe are working with like-minded partners as well to say that Hamas has no role in a future Palestinian state\u201d. \n  Albanese reiterated that \u201cevery innocent life matters, whether they be Israeli or Palestinian\u201d and he repeated Australia\u2019s call for the immediate release of all hostages held by Hamas (the Coalition has been claiming that the government has gone relatively silent on calling for hostages, even though ministers have repeated the call on almost every occasion they have been asked). \n  And in a further defence of Wong\u2019s speech, Albanese noted that her comments were very similar to the position outlined by the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, David Cameron. This was pushback at the idea that Australia was acting out in front of its allies. \n  \n Updated at 4.12am BST \n \n \n  4.00am BST  \n Alinta Energy CEO says higher costs inevitable for large scale renewables \n  \n  We\u2019ll go now to Canberra where managing director and CEO of Alinta Energy, Jeff Dimery, has been speaking at the National Press Club. \n  He noted Aemo says a true transformation of the national electricity market will require \u201clevels of investment in generation, storage transmission and system services that exceed all previous efforts combined\u201d. So what is stopping more private companies investing in renewables? \n  Dimery said: \n   \n   I mentioned retail margins are relatively low \u2026 If it\u2019s not an industry flush with profits, then how can it invest in new generation? Not on the scale required for transition in any event, and despite the profits reported in the last financial year, the investment outlook for large scale renewables is challenging. Let me tell you why. Higher costs and uncertainty about recovering them, that\u2019s why \u2026 \n   When I sat down to write this speech, the future Victorian energy price for the 2026 calendar year was $58 a megawatt hour. In 2026, we will still have plenty of brown coal in the system, producing round-the-clock baseload energy. It will be topped up by a decent amount of large scale renewables and rooftop PV.  \n   That\u2019s great, but at $58, I can\u2019t build anything to meaningfully prepare for coal to come out of the system. I can\u2019t build more solar because we have a solar glut in the middle of the day, sending spot prices deeply negative. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.09am BST \n \n \n  3.50am BST  \n  \n  Eyewear retailer behind OPSM, Oakley and Sunglass Hut fined for spam messages \n  Eyewear retailer Luxottica has been fined over $1.5m for sending over 200,000 marketing messages in breach of Australian spam law.The company behind OPSM, Oakley and Sunglass Hut was found by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) to have sent 91,231 marketing emails without an unsubscribe function, and 112,348 texts and emails from customers who had previously unsubscribed.The messages were sent between November 2022 and May 2023. \n  Acma member Samantha Yorke said: \n   \n   Businesses must keep up their side of the bargain and stop sending these messages when customers ask them to. \n   \n  Acma noted around half of the emails without the unsubscribe link were order confirmations or password reset emails that contained commercial content such as how to buy products. \n  Acma has been on a blitz against companies over spam act breaches, with fines issued to companies including Uber, Outdoor Supacentre and Kmart in recent months.

But the relationship between Israel and Australia is deep and profoundly important to both sides, it secures both parties and will endure no doubt \u2026 We would urge the foreign minister to reconsider this position. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.28am BST \n \n \n  12.13am BST  \n Environment minister defends approval of coalmines during her term \n  \n  Environment and water minister Tanya Plibersek says the government is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the ongoing bleaching event affecting the Great Barrier Reef. \n  Speaking on ABC RN earlier this morning, Plibersek noted there have been concerning bleaching events across the world and said: \n   \n   We need to protect the reef because it\u2019s unique in the world, and also 64,000 people rely on it for their work. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing whatever we can, first of all, to get Australia to net zero. We\u2019ve got 43% emissions reduction target and net zero by 2050, we\u2019re working very hard to get to 82% renewable energy. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve put $1.2bn into protecting the reef, improving water quality, getting gillnets out of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. I rejected a coalmine that would have had impacts on the reef \u2026 \n   \n  Q: You have approved several other coalmines during your term? \n  Plibersek acknowledged she had and argued this was \u201cbecause Australia has to get to net zero by 2050 and every new project that we approve is now part of the safeguard mechanism\u201d: \n   \n   And you know what would have made a real difference? If 10 years ago our carbon pollution reduction scheme hadn\u2019t been blocked by the Greens and the Liberals who would have seen 80m fewer tonnes of carbon pollution in our atmosphere. \n   We need to get on with the safeguard mechanism that has been approved by the parliament, with the support of the Greens and the crossbench \u2026 and our trajectory to net zero. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.55am BST \n \n \n  12.04am BST  \n  \n  Penny Wong\u2019s position on recognising Palestinian state \u2018chasing green votes\u2019, Sussan Ley argues \n  Deputy opposition leader Sussan Ley has joined in on criticism of Penny Wong\u2019s speech last night, signalling the potential for recognising a Palestinian state as a way of achieving a two-state solution. \n  Speaking on Sky News this morning, Ley argued this was a \u201cdomestic policy decision\u201d aimed at \u201cchasing green votes\u201d, and that it demonstrates division within the Labor party: \n   \n   To make such a decision for domestic political purposes is not good for our national security. \n   \n  As we noted earlier, Wong has not announced a decision on the matter. She has signalled discussions are happening within the international community around this, including Australia. \n  Ley said she supported a future Palestinian state with a reformed Palestinian Authority, but \u201cthe problem is that [it] is neither reformed nor in charge\u201d: \n   \n   Hamas is in charge in the Gaza strip and a decision like this by Australia watched from that region will be seen, I believe, only as emboldening the terrorists. \n   \n  As Josh Butler reported, during her speech Wong said a \u201creformed Palestinian Authority\u201d would have to lead any Palestinian state and she flatly rejected any future role for Hamas. \n  \n Updated at 12.18am BST \n \n \n  11.48pm BST  \n  \n  Birmingham doubles down on criticism of Penny Wong\u2019s speech \n  Shadow foreign minister Simon Birmingham has doubled down on his criticism of Penny Wong\u2019s speech last night, which signalled the government may consider recognising Palestinian statehood as a pathway to a two-state solution. \n  Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, Birmingham said Wong needed to make her prerequisites for this position clear, and whether this included the removal of Hamas. \n  Wong addressed this during her speech last night. She said a \u201creformed Palestinian Authority\u201d would have to lead any Palestinian state and flatly rejected any future role for Hamas. \n  Birmingham said this morning: \n   \n   To be simultaneously urging for a ceasefire that would seem to leave Hamas in place is, of course, not going to achieve the type of outcome or environment that could give you a secure environment for a two-state solution to be negotiated. \n   \n  Host Lisa Millar asked: Is the way Israel is currently carrying out this war going to put the area on the path to peace? \n  Birmingham did not comment on any actions of Israel, and argued the war would only end when \u201cHamas is removed [and] they have handed over the hostages\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 11.55pm BST \n \n \n  11.38pm BST  \n  \n  Eid comes at anxious time for many, Albanese says \n  The prime minister has issued a statement for Eid al-Fitr, noting it is a special time for Muslim Australians to \u201ccome together as a community in prayer, hospitality and generosity\u201d. \n  Anthony Albanese said: \n   \n   This year the suffering in Gaza will mean many Muslim Australians will mark Eid al-Fitr with sorrow.

Only 13% said they wanted a slow transition. \n  Andrea Walton, the senior social scientist on the project, said: \n   \n   Many Australians held generally moderate attitudes towards living near renewable energy infrastructure, suggesting a broad willingness to support, or at least tolerate, the development of solar farms, onshore and offshore wind farms, and associated transmission line infrastructure. \n   Transmission lines were seen less favourably compared to other renewable energy infrastructure. The survey revealed an important reason for this was that people didn\u2019t always recognise the role of additional transmission lines in the renewable energy transition. \n   \n  The survey found affordability was the most common energy priority, followed by emissions reduction, and well ahead of minimising power outages. \n  A question on attitudes to the environment found 51% said it was fragile and would be protected only if there were large changes in human behaviour and society, while 19% who said it could be managed by the government and experts if there were clear rules. \n  \n \n \n  11.23pm BST  \n  \n  Chalmers comments on proposed revamp to merger laws \n  Jim Chalmers was asked about the proposed merger laws, and how these would impact everyday Australians day-to-day. \n  In case you missed it: the revamped competition laws would require companies to notify the competition watchdog of mergers of a certain size, designed to reduce unfair market concentration. Paul Karp has the full story below: \n   \n    Related: Labor targets unfair company mergers in competition policy overhaul  \n   \n  Chalmers said a more competitive economy meant \u201cmore choices for people at fair prices\u201d. \n   \n   Our economy is not competitive enough as it stands, and it\u2019s been getting less competitive over recent decades and that comes at a cost to everyone and we want to address that, because a more competitive economy is better for consumers, it\u2019s better for businesses and it\u2019s better for the economy more broadly. \n   \n  Chalmers said if a potential merger raised competition concerns, the ACCC could apply a test of whether it lessened competition, or whether it expanded market power. He said this would allow good mergers to proceed quicker, and concern mergers to receive \u201ca bit more robust scrutiny\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 11.32pm BST \n \n \n  11.16pm BST  \n  \n  Chalmers backs foreign minister Penny Wong\u2019s speech \n  Treasurer Jim Chalmers has backed the speech made by foreign minister Penny Wong last night. Speaking on ABC AM earlier, he was asked about comments from the opposition that recognition of a Palestinian state would reward Hamas.  \n  Is that the danger here? \u201cNo\u201d, Chalmers said. \n   \n   I was there at the Australian National University for [Wong\u2019s] characteristically considered and thoughtful contribution. She made a number of points, but among them was the point that if we want to build a pathway out of this endless cycle of violence and bloodshed, then a two-state solution offers us the best chance and that\u2019s why the international community, including our friends around the world, are considering whether recognition builds momentum towards that two-state solution and the peaceful future that we want for people on both sides of that horrendous conflict. \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.12pm BST  \n  \n  Division dangerous for our democracy, Wong says \n  Wrapping up the interview, Penny Wong is asked about tensions at home between some Muslim and Jewish communities. Does she believe these tensions have eased? \n  Wong told ABC RN people need to be \u201cless condemnatory, more respectful of one another\u201d: \n   \n   People are increasingly struggling with how to discuss this with their fellow citizens, and we\u2019ve seen antisemitism, we\u2019ve seen Islamophobia, we\u2019ve seen language and behaviours that shows that people are losing respect for one another \u2013 that is dangerous for our democracy. We have to be peacemakers at home \u2026 We gain nothing by reproducing the conflict here, we gain nothing by shouting each other down and we gain nothing by delegitimising or belittling one another and there\u2019s been far too much of that in the discussion. \n   \n  Turning the lens on politicians, Wong accused the Greens of using \u201cpeople\u2019s distress in order to campaign for votes\u201d: \n   \n   [That] has been appalling and there are consequences to that sort of behaviour and we all ought to act more as leaders and peacemakers rather than using this for political campaigning purposes. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.31pm BST \n \n \n  11.07pm BST  \n  \n  Attack on aid workers under spotlight \n  Q: You and [defence minister] Richard Marles wrote a letter to the Israeli government saying that appropriate action should be taken against those IDF personnel, if they didn\u2019t act in accordance with the law. What is appropriate action if that is the case? \n  Penny Wong: \n   \n   Well, certainly I\u2019ve been I\u2019ve said before and I\u2019ve said our job as a government is to find out what the facts are and then make decisions and on the basis of those facts. \n   \n  Q: Have you had a response from the Israeli government to that letter? \n  Wong: \n   \n   Not as yet, but we look forward to a response. \n   \n  Q: What are the consequences if there isn\u2019t full accountability and transparency from the investigations? \n  Wong: \n   \n   My focus at the moment is to engage with the Israeli government to ensure that there is transparency and accountability. And I would say it is in Israel\u2019s interests for the Australian government [and] Australia community to be satisfied that there has been transparency and accountability. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.30pm BST \n \n \n  11.03pm BST  \n  \n  \u2018Aid workers are to be protected\u2019 \n  Penny Wong was also asked to provide an update on the work done by Mark Binskin so far, who was appointed special adviser on Israel\u2019s response to the deaths of World Central Kitchen aid workers, including Australian Zomi Frankcom. \n  Wong said the Australian government was engaging with Israel about Binskin\u2019s appointment: \n   \n   There are positive engagements and we appreciate that this is a very important issue for Australia. We have been saying for a very long time it is important that international humanitarian law be adhered to. \n   Under international humanitarian law, as you know, aid workers are to be protected. Demonstrably, there was a deadly failure of deconfliction \u2013 deconfliction being the ways in which making sure that defence forces are aware of where humanitarian workers are so they can be protected and there was a deadly failure. \n   Australians do expect there to be transparency and full accountability and we\u2019ve appointed Mark Binskin as a special adviser because he will be able to assist the Australian government in considering the investigation against those principles that I\u2019ve outlined. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.29pm BST \n \n \n  10.59pm BST  \n Support for two-state solution v recognition of Palestinian statehood \n  \n  The key takeaway from Penny Wong\u2019s speech last night, and her comments this morning, is the hint Australia may move towards unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, in conjunction with other countries. \n  This is slightly different to support for a two-state solution, which has always been Australia\u2019s position. \n  Wong has made no decision and has not committed to recognition but said this is part of a broader debate within the international community right now. \n  She was asked directly about this on ABC RN, if Australia is ready and willing to recognise Palestine as a state? \n  Wong: \n   \n   We\u2019ve made no such decision, the discussion I want to have is to look at what is happening in the international community where there is the very important debate about how it is we secure long-lasting peace in a region where which has known so much conflict. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.25pm BST \n \n \n  10.53pm BST  \n  \n  Peace can\u2019t be achieved in long term until statehood resolved, Wong says \n  Penny Wong has also responded to criticism to her speech, that recognition of a Palestinian state would reward Hamas for the 7 October attack. \n  Wong refuted this and said the Australian government has been, and is, calling for the release of hostages: \n   \n   But my point is a longer term point about what is the path to peace. I don\u2019t see ultimately, any security for Israel without the issue of Palestinian statehood being resolved, and whether it\u2019s the continued normalisation of relationships from other countries in the region, such as Saudi Arabia \u2013 who obviously has said very clearly there will be no normalisation until that issue is resolved \u2013 there is no case for [peace] in the long term, unless this issue is resolved. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.15pm BST \n \n \n  10.48pm BST  \n  \n  \u2018Do not go down this path\u2019 \n  Speaking on ABC RN, Penny Wong said the Australian government was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about a proposed ground invasion in Rafah by Israel: \n   \n   Israel was attacked in the most horrific terms by an organisation which is dedicated to the destruction of the Jewish people \u2026 which is Hamas. And more Jewish lives were lost in that day than any single day since the Holocaust. So any state attacked in that way would defend itself. The point I also made is any state that does defend itself is bound by certain rules, and we are concerned about the humanitarian implications and consequences for civilians in Rafah, as is the president of the United States when we have said to Israel: do not go down this path. \n   We know how many Palestinians are sheltering there, people fled because of the conflict in Gaza and they have nowhere to go. And we are alongside with the president of the United States and so many others in the international community, we are urging Israel to not go down this path. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.16pm BST \n \n \n  10.45pm BST  \n \u2018Security for Israel only achieved if Palestinian state alongside it,\u2019 Wong says \n  \n  Foreign minister Penny Wong has been speaking to ABC RN about her speech last night, when she said recognition of a Palestinian state may provide a pathway towards a two-state solution. \n  She flagged that the government was considering this during a speech in Canberra last night: \n   \n    Related: Palestinian state recognition the only hope to end violence in Middle East, Penny Wong says  \n   \n  Speaking to ABC RN, Wong reiterated the points made during her speech. She said among the international community, there is a debate ongoing about how to \u201csecure long-lasting peace in a region which has known so much conflict\u201d: \n   \n   Obviously we have the immediate conflict, we need to see Hamas release hostages, we need to see a revitalised Palestinian Authority, we need to see an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. We need all of these things immediately. But the point I\u2019m making is that ultimately, peace and security for Israel will only be achieved if we have a Palestinian state alongside the Israeli state. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.54am BST \n \n \n  10.41pm BST  \n Birmingham says recognition of Palestinian state would be \u2018dangerous\u2019 \n  \n  The federal opposition has responded to comments made by foreign affairs minister Penny Wong last night that recognising a Palestinian state was \u201cthe only hope\u201d to end violence in the Middle East. \n  In case you missed it, Wong said the recognition of a Palestinian state is \u201cthe only hope to break the endless cycle of violence\u201d in the Middle East and a two-state solution would help ensure long-term security for Israel and further undermine Hamas.

[2024-04-05T22:34:34Z]": "Millions of Australians will gain an hour when daylight saving time for 2024 ends this weekend. Clocks will go back to standard time, giving residents in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory an extra hour of sleep this weekend. Here\u2019s what you need to know. When does daylight saving end? Daylight saving time for 2024 will end this Sunday 7 April, at 3am. For states and territories using daylight saving, the time will immediately jump back to 2am. Clocks always swap back to standard time on the first Sunday of April. Do clocks move forward or back? Clocks move back by an hour when daylight saving ends. Digital clocks should move back automatically early on Sunday morning, but you\u2019ll need to set your analogue clocks an hour earlier when you wake up. A daylight saving-set clock showing 7am time should be adjusted back to 6am to align your clock with standard time.    Which states have daylight saving time? Daylight saving time applies in NSW, SA, ACT, Victoria and Tasmania. Residents in those states will be setting their clocks back an hour this Sunday. Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory don\u2019t observe daylight saving, so they won\u2019t gain or lose an hour.  Queensland will finally be back on the same clock as the rest of the east coast by Sunday morning, after spending the past six months running an hour earlier. Why do we have daylight saving?   Related: What time does daylight saving start in Australia in 2023? Do clocks go forward, or back in October? And more questions answered in your quick guide    Australia first adopted daylight saving time during the first and second world wars, hoping to reduce energy usage. Then Tasmania permanently introduced daylight saving in 1968, while NSW, Victoria, SA and the ACT adopted it from 1971. The shifting hours give Australians extra evening sunlight for social activities and exercise after work or school. Daylight saving also helps reduce the change of energy outages, according to associate professor Virginie Masson. \u201cIt spreads the load of networks, rather than having peak times where you could potentially have issues with excess demand for your electricity,\u201d she said. Queensland and Western Australia have dumped the practice due to its unpopularity while the Northern Territory never tried it again after the second world war. Australia\u2019s north gets more sun later in the day, even without daylight saving, because it\u2019s closer to the Earth\u2019s equator.    Is daylight saving bad for your health? While there are mental health benefits to having extra sunlight, moving in and out of daylight saving time is bad for your health. \u201cIt\u2019s confusing our body clock, which is disrupting all kinds of functions throughout the body,\u201d said Dr Jacob Crouse, research fellow at the University of Sydney\u2019s Brain and Mind Centre. Crouse is one of many body clock scientists who say Australia should permanently stick to standard time throughout the year. Our sleep, stress levels, immune system, appetite regulation (feeling hungry or full), and hormone production can all go \u201cout of whack\u201d, he said. In the worst-case scenario, research has found daylight saving time also increases the risk of heart attacks and infectious diseases. Do you get paid for working daylight saving time? Workers on early Sunday morning shifts may lose an hour of pay when clocks move back at 3am. Some employment agreements have specific rules about daylight saving pay but workers without specific rules will only be paid by the clock. When will daylight saving time start again? For those who like having a bit more daylight in their evenings, you\u2019ll need to wait until the first Sunday in October. In 2024, that falls on 6 October. ", "Biden says Israel is not doing enough to protect aid workers and calls for inquiry [2024-04-03T01:13:06Z]": "Joe Biden has said that Israel is not doing enough to protect aid workers and has called for a swift investigation into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) drone attack in Gaza which killed seven people working for the World Central Kitchen (WCK) charity. \u201cThis conflict has been one of the worst in recent memory in terms of how many aid workers have been killed,\u201d the US president said, in comments that were highly critical of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza.   Related: Gaza aid convoy strike: what happened and who were the victims?    The strike on the WCK convoy killed citizens of Australia, Britain and Poland as well as Palestinians and a dual citizen of the US and Canada. Early on Wednesday, the IDF chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, put the strike down to \u201cmisidentification\u201d, adding that the \u201cthe strike was not carried out with the intention of harming WCK aid workers,\u201d and that it was a mistake that should not have happened. Biden said he was \u201coutraged and heartbroken\u201d by the aid workers\u2019 deaths and highlighted that this was not a standalone incident. \u201cThis is a major reason why distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza has been so difficult \u2013 because Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians \u2026 Israel has also not done enough to protect civilians.\u201d More than 200 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since the war between Israel and Hamas began after the militant group\u2019s attack on Israeli communities on 7 October, Jamie McGoldrick, the UN\u2019s top official for the coordination of humanitarian aid in Gaza, said on Tuesday. The attack on WCK was not an \u201cisolated incident\u201d, he added, pointing out that the number of humanitarians killed in the last six months in Gaza was nearly three times as high as the death toll recorded in any other single conflict in a year. On Tuesday, WCK named Jacob Flickinger as the US-Canada dual citizen working for the aid group who was killed in the attack. In the aftermath of the drone attack, several charities including WCK announced they would suspend operations in Gaza, leading to fears that the humanitarian catastrophe in the territory would worsen. One of the charities, Aneran, said the deaths of the WCK workers led their team to conclude that \u201cdelivering aid safely is no longer feasible\u201d. According to Oxfam, since December, the number of people in Gaza facing \u201ccatastrophic levels\u201d of hunger has nearly doubled. At least 27 children have died of malnutrition, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry. Biden\u2019s criticism of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza has grown over recent weeks and his frustration with Benjamin Netanyahu has become increasingly visible. Last month Biden said the Israeli prime minister \u201cmust pay more attention to the innocent lives being lost as a consequence of the actions taken\u201d in Gaza and that his stance was detrimental to Israel\u2019s interests. The attack on the WCK aid convoy drew condemnation from leaders around the world. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, called for an urgent investigation into the attack and told Netanyahu in a conversation that far too many aid workers and ordinary civilians had lost their lives in Gaza. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he had demanded \u201cfull accountability\u201d over the incident and \u201cconveyed to Prime Minister Netanyahu in very clear terms that Australians were outraged\u201d by the death of the Australian aid worker.", "Middle East crisis: Iran\u2019s state media says vessel \u2018linked to Israel\u2019 seized by Revolutionary Guards \u2013 as it happened [2024-04-13T14:57:16Z]": " \n  3.57pm BST  \n Closing summary \n  \n  It has just gone 4.45pm in Gaza, 5.45pm in Tel Aviv and Damascus, and 6.15pm in Tehran.

Cameron said he had discussed \u201cour shared concerns about Iranian threats to attack Israel\u201d with Gantz. \u201cFurther escalation in the region is in no one\u2019s interest and risks further loss of civilian life,\u201d he added. \n   US president Joe Biden said he expects an Iranian attack on Israel \u201csooner rather than later\u201d and issued a last-ditch message to Tehran: \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe are devoted to the defence of Israel. We will support Israel. We will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed,\u201d Biden told reporters on Friday. Biden\u2019s comments came as the White House warned that the prospect of an Iranian attack on Israel in retaliation for the bombing of an Iranian consular building in Syria was \u201cstill a viable threat\u201d. \n   Australian airline Qantas said on Saturday it would redirect its long-haul flights between Perth and London to avoid Iran\u2019s airspace amid soaring Middle East tensions.

KLM, the Dutch arm of Air France-KLM, said the move was a precaution, but added that it would continue flying to Tel Aviv, on Israel\u2019s Mediterranean coast. \n   The Netherlands will close its embassy in Tehran on Sunday as a \u201cprecaution\u201d, the Dutch Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday, citing the rising tensions between Iran and Israel. The ministry added that it would decide on Sunday whether the embassy would reopen on Monday. \n   An overnight Israeli attack destroyed the Abu Bakr as-Siddiq mosque and also damaged nearby houses in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, reported Al Jazeera. \n   At least 33,686 Palestinians have been killed and 76,309 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, according to the latest figures from the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas. This includes 52 Palestinians that were killed and 95 that were injured in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours.

According to the AP, the video showed the attack earlier reported by the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO). Earlier updates from the UKMTO offered no details about the boarding in the Gulf of Oman off the Emirati port city of Fujairah, except that the vessel had been \u201creported to have been seized by regional authorities\u201d. \n  Iran did not immediately acknowledge seizing any vessel, nor was there any report carried by state media about the incident. The defence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity with the AP to discuss intelligence matters, shared the video with the news agency. In it, the commandos are said to have descended on to a stack of containers sitting on the deck of the vessel. \n  The AP say that a crew member on the ship could be heard saying: \u201cDon\u2019t come out.\u201d He then tells his colleagues to go to the ship\u2019s bridge as more commandos come down on the deck. It adds that, one commando can be seen kneeling above the others to provide them potential cover from fire. Though the AP could not immediately verify the video, it said that it corresponded to known details of the boarding, and the helicopter involved appeared to be one used by Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guards, which has carried out other ship raids in the past. The AP report that the vessel involved is likely the Portuguese-flagged MSC Aries, a container ship associated with London-based Zodiac Maritime. Zodiac Maritime is part of Israeli billionaire Eyal Ofer\u2019s Zodiac Group, it adds. Neither MSC nor Zodiac immediately responded to a request for comment by the AP.

The Hamas media office said 25 people were taken to hospital in Deir al-Balah city \u201cas a result of an airstrike on a house of the al-Tabatibi family\u201d. Israel\u2019s military said its aircraft had struck more than 60 militant targets in Gaza over the previous day. \n   Dozens of angry Israeli settlers have stormed into a Palestinian village in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, shooting and setting houses and cars on fire. Palestinian health officials said one Palestinian man was killed and 25 others wounded in the attack. An Israeli rights group said the settlers were searching for a 14-year-old boy missing from their settlement. After the rampage, Israeli troops said they were still searching for the boy. \n   At least 33,634 Palestinians have been killed and 76,214 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, according to the latest figures from the territory\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry. \n   \n   \n   France has warned its citizens to \u201cimperatively refrain from travel in the coming days to Iran, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian territories\u201d.

The lawsuit has been issued by four human rights groups on behalf of five named Palestinians who say they are in fear of their lives in Gaza and are suffering a form of collective punishment by Israel. \n   A Unicef spokesperson says she was on an aid mission on Tuesday when the UN-marked vehicle she was in was shot, she told Australia\u2019s ABC News on Friday. Tess Ingram, an Australian, said the Israeli military and Hamas were aware of the convoy\u2019s movements as part of the mission, but she did not see the source of the gunfire. \u201cIt appeared to come from the direction of the checkpoint towards civilians, who then turned and ran in the other direction,\u201d she said. \n   A Turkish state television journalist was badly injured and another slightly hurt in Gaza, the TRT channel said, adding that the team\u2019s vehicle had been targeted by an Israeli strike. The team from TRT Arabi, its Arabic-language channel, was preparing to broadcast from the Nuseirat camp, the broadcaster said.

Writing ahead of an open letter the charity is delivering to ministers, Oxfam said: \u201cThe prime minister and the foreign secretary have repeatedly defended the UK\u2019s decision to continue arms sales.

Related: Fleeing bloodshed in Gaza, Palestinians arriving in Australia find they have no place to call home    Into this void have stepped community organisations. Some have organised donation drives to provide people with essential items including clothes and furniture; others have worked to provide food, alongside legal and settlement services. Shanglish, a restaurant and cafe chain in Bankstown, has shut down one of its branches and repurposed it as a soup kitchen for the holy month of Ramadan, during which Muslims fast from dawn until sunset. Community Care Kitchen organised the recommissioning of Shanglish, paying the rent and staff salaries for a month and using it to provide families from Gaza food packages to break their fast. Sana Karanouh, one of the leading volunteers at the organisation, says the repurposed cafe cannot meet the demand. \u201cWe are spending upwards of $5,000 a day feeding up to 45 families a night,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have faced an influx of people, struggling without government support and amid this cost-of-living crisis. \u201cThe families who are fed by the program are extremely grateful, they tell us it\u2019s the only good thing happening to them at the moment.\u201d Karanouh explains that families register with the organisation, then call to place an order in the morning that they can pick up just before sunset.     \u201cOn the first two days of Ramadan, our phone lines completely collapsed due to the demand,\u201d she says. \u201cWe tend to get different people every day, different families.

Community consultation closes this week on a plan by the City of Boroondara to restore about 15% of the council\u2019s 22km of concrete roads, which were constructed during the early 20th century across suburbs such as Balwyn, Camberwell, Glen Iris, Hawthorn and Surrey Hills. Daniel Freer, the council\u2019s director of places and spaces, told Guardian Australia that 3km of road had been earmarked for restoration within its heritage precincts, including Boroondara\u2019s oldest concrete road.   Related: EPA issues warning to councils after asbestos found in Melbourne parks    \u201cBoroondara\u2019s first concrete road, Compton Street, Canterbury, was constructed in 1925, and roads in the Hassett and Golf Links Estates suburbs were constructed circa 1927,\u201d he said. \u201cThese roads comprise just over 3km of council concrete roads and fall under Boroondara\u2019s heritage precincts as providing a \u2018predominantly intact interwar landscape containing concrete roads\u2019.\u201d According to the draft plan, concrete roads were installed in several subdivisions during the period between the first and second world wars and \u201ccontribute to the municipality\u2019s interwar heritage character\u201d. But it noted many of the roads were \u201cextensively cracked\u201d, \u201cageing\u201d and \u201cpatching\u201d.    Under the policy, the council would undertake \u201crepair and restoration works\u201d to small sections of the heritage-listed roads using concrete \u201crather than a full road reconstruction\u201d. It would also aim to match the colour of the concrete to the original \u201cas much as practical\u201d. If repairs are not possible, it would reconstruct the full road using concrete. The remaining 19km of concrete roads in the area, which are not under heritage overlay, would be reconstructed with asphalt. The plan said this was the council\u2019s \u201cpreferred surface\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The council\u2019s website said concrete roads were \u201cup to three times the cost of replacing with asphalt\u201d and were harder to maintain and repair, as well as less smooth for drivers. \u201cConcrete roads need to be textured to create enough grip. This can lead to the road surface being more uneven, bumpy and noisy when compared to asphalt roads,\u201d it said.    The new policy also includes a plan to maintain the area\u2019s bluestone kerbs, which it said were \u201cconsidered by some to contribute to the heritage character of our neighbourhoods\u201d. Freer said community feedback would be considered by the council before the guidelines were introduced. The historian Dr James Lesh of conservation consultancy Heritage Workshop said it was important the council maintain some of its concrete roads to preserve its history and uniqueness. \u201cThis is something that contributes to the neighbourhood, like trees, gardens, statues and cast iron fences and other things that are heritage listed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why they can\u2019t be incorporated into conservation protections and it means we don\u2019t end up with every single neighbourhood and every single area of the city just looking exactly the same.\u201d Lesh said it was not uncommon for roads to be heritage listed, citing the Great Ocean Road, which was built as a memorial to Victoria\u2019s first world war servicemen and women, and St Kilda Road, one of Melbourne\u2019s grandest major thoroughfares. But Jonathan O\u2019Brien from Yimby Melbourne said it was another example of \u201coverreach\u201d by councils when it comes to heritage protections.    \u201cNo one actually thinks concrete roads are a valuable part of society, do they?\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t live in 1950s America. We live in 2024 Australia in the midst of both a housing and climate crisis and at a time when councils are under a rate cap that means they don\u2019t have any money to fund infrastructure and services. \u201cBut they still insist on allocating their funds towards things like this. It feels tone deaf.\u201d O\u2019Brien said 32% of developable land in Boroondara was heritage protected. His group has called on the state government to abolish heritage overlays in cases where negative social impacts are greater than the benefits. \u201cIn the case of these roads \u2026 the council have made it clear these roads are less safe and more expensive. They know this, yet they\u2019re still doing it.\u201d", "Horseback archery draws new riders across Australia: \u2018You can ride on any horse with any gear\u2019 [2024-04-10T15:00:34Z]": "As her horse gains pace, Kimberley Robertson draws a 30-pound recurve bow and stands high in her saddle. A moment later a 70cm carbon-fibre arrow fletched with pink-dyed turkey feathers thumps into a foam target. Surrounded by a paddock of cattle at dusk on her family property two hours west of Brisbane, the 25-year-old Robertson is training for the national horse archery championships. \u201cI\u2019ve done archery since I was 13 and I\u2019ve always ridden horses, so combining the two, well, that seemed cool,\u201d she says, rounding the arena for another run at the target.   Related: Concern grows over mystery horse deaths in Victoria as toll rises to 13    Six years ago Robertson and a few friends founded the local Lockyer Valley horse archery club. In a few days Robertson and her horse, Chiko, will travel more than 1,000km to a property in north-east Victoria to make their debut on the national stage. \u201cI\u2019m nervous for sure,\u201d Robertson says. \u201cSome people have heard of it, they\u2019ve seen it in TV shows, but they don\u2019t realise it\u2019s actually a sport in Australia.\u201d  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Competing against 10 other riders across three events at the canter, Robertson will be judged by the accuracy of her shots and pace of her horse. One event requires competitors to ride along a 90-metre raid track and hit three ground targets while going as fast as possible. The tower track works the same but riders must instead land three arrows on a target, which is set 2 metres above ground. The last course is the hunt track of up to 20 targets at all angles over cross-country terrain. \u201cThe true origin of the sport comes from countries that had a lot of cavalry in their history and is very much based in war, martial skill and hunting,\u201d says Liberty Deaman, the Australian representative of the International Horseback Archery Alliance.    The 2024 championships in Cheshunt will be the largest to date, with 21 entries. Deaman says the sport\u2019s popularity has grown because it is \u201ca very inclusive sport as horse riding goes \u2026 Not many of them are.\u201d As well as the fast-paced canter events, riders can compete in walk or trot classes, which are more forgiving for beginners. There are also options for people with disabilities to take part. \u201cThat makes it very, very welcoming for a lot of people,\u201dDeaman says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a really good sport to build a bond and strong line of communication with your horse.\u201d Robertson agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not cliquey or judgy,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a lot of horse sports you have to have the right gear and the right horse, where as in archery you can ride on any horse with any gear as long you\u2019re safe.\u201d The rise of medieval festivals and events in Australia and their growing popularity on social media is also contributing to greater interest. In September Deaman travelled to the world horse archery championships in Mongolia. \u201cWe did everything through social media, all of our fundraising, all of our publications and publicity \u2026 we had a really massive response,\u201d she says. But, as a small sport on a large continent, many competitors have to travel long distances to find their nearest event. Riders who can\u2019t bring their own horses are catch-riding, competing on a horse they\u2019ve never ridden before.  \u201cThe Queensland teams are probably travelling somewhere close to 20 hours all up,\u201d Deaman says. \u201cThat certainly can be stressful for the horses \u2013 it\u2019s a big commitment to make.\u201d As the competition approaches, Robertson is making preparations for the two-day journey so it\u2019s as comfortable as possible for Chiko, 15, while cramming in a bit more practice. \u201cI\u2019ll just let my horse do what I\u2019ve taught him to do and let off arrows as quick as I bloody can,\u201d she says.

It\u2019s not about Japan being part of the Five Eyes intelligence community,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s Radio National. China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said the US, UK and Australia were \u201csending signals of Aukus expansion\u201d and \u201cescalating [an] arms race in the Asia-Pacific to the detriment of peace and stability in the region\u201d. \u201cChina is gravely concerned about it,\u201d Ning said. \u201cWe oppose relevant countries cobbling together exclusive groupings and stoking bloc confrontation. \u201cJapan needs to earnestly draw lessons from history and stay prudent on military and security issues.\u201d Japan became a pacifist nation after the second world war, when the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and enforced a constitution that the nation never maintain military forces. About a decade later, it created the Self-Defense Forces. More recently, in reaction to China\u2019s belligerence and North Korea\u2019s aggressive tactics, it has been increasing its defence spending and capability.

Melbourne\u2019s Metro Tunnel is set to open in 2025, a year ahead of schedule, and will create capacity for trains to run constantly from the Cranbourne/Pakenham lines through to the Sunbury line. The premier, Jacinta Allan, and transport infrastructure minister, Danny Pearson, visited State Library station on Sunday to share that crews successfully ran test trains two minutes apart between West Footscray and Hawksburn stations. Crews have clocked over 16,500km running through the tunnels since July \u2013 paving the way to begin trial operations with drivers and station staff by year\u2019s end. The Metro Tunnel will connect the busy Sunbury, Cranbourne and Pakenham lines through a new tunnel under the city, creating an end-to-end rail line from the north-west to the south-east \u2013 freeing up space in the City Loop and creating capacity to run more trains more often. Allan told reporters on Sunday that the turn-up-and-go services was an exciting prospect.

Unable to form a majority government after securing just 14 seats at the 23 March poll, the Tasmanian parliament will be led by the Liberals and include 10 Labor seats, five Greens, three Jacqui Lambie Network and three independents.    The Liberal party has been in power a decade and Rockliff called an early election in a bid to secure majority government. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, the premier said that despite falling short of his goal he will \u201cembrace the opportunity to work with the expanded parliament \u2026 that is truly reflective of the people who voted for it\u201d.  I\u2019m excited about this parliament. They\u2019ve [voters] given us a kick up the backside and we note that, we reflect on that. We will respect, with maturity, the will of the Tasmanian people and they expect us to get on with the job.  Rockliff said his constructive and positive discussions with Jacqui Lambie Network members and independents continued. A third of Tasmanians snubbed the two major parties at the election, with the Liberals receiving 37% of the primary vote and Labor 29%.

Asbestos fragments have been confirmed at Crofts Reserve. The EPA says asbestos fragments found at PJ Lynch Reserve in Altona North and bonded asbestos debris at Donald McLean Reserve in Spotswood are likely to be the result of illegal waste dumping. The EPA said in a statement:  The EPA believes the source of asbestos and other contaminants at the site was illegal dumping of construction and demolition waste after the mulch was delivered.  Two small \u201ccement sheet like\u201d fragments found by a concerned resident in Shore Reserve in Pascoe Vale South are yet to be confirmed as asbestos, but the EPA says it is likely to come from littering rather than in mulch supplied to the park.    Inspections are also taking place in Merri-bek after reports of asbestos fragments being seen during the construction of Hosken Reserve in North Coburg in January. The EPA says asbestos is in the soil, rather than linked to a mulch supplier. Merri-bek council confirmed the asbestos-contaminated soil was found within the area closed for the major upgrade works. - AAP    Updated at 6.04am BST     5.15am BST       International humanitarian law must be upheld, PM says The PM is also asked about the appointment of a special adviser to the federal government on the investigation into the killing of Zomi Frankcom.

We\u2019ve been informed that the river has peaked, and so it will start to be going down now \u2026 here at the Windsor Bridge, it\u2019s peaked and we don\u2019t anticipate at all that the bridge will go under.

What is really significant about today is what the minister said about the declaration of disaster, what that does in only 24 hours following a serious disaster is it triggers support for my community. It triggers support for our council to repair essential infrastructure, whether that\u2019s roads or sporting facilities. It triggers support for all the sports clubs \u2026 it also triggers the initial support for our primary producers and for our residents who are affected.         4.15am BST       Flood waters not expected to subside until tomorrow NSW SES commissioner Carlene York says there are still 60 warnings regarding ongoing flood waters. She says they aren\u2019t expected to subside until this evening or throughout tomorrow.  There are some areas where the evacuations are still current. What we\u2019re moving to today is to assess the damage at those different communities across the state that have been affected by this significant weather event and working with our partner agencies to do that. And as soon as it\u2019s safe, we will be lifting those evacuation orders so that people can go into their houses and start cleaning up all their properties. There\u2019s still a lot of roads cut and there\u2019s still a lot of danger out there. And that obviously will worsen as the night comes, not with the rain, but with the ability to see what\u2019s on the road and to be able to assess the danger. So again, telling the community not to drive through flood waters, we\u2019ve had way too many rescues required to go and assist people to get out of those flood waters, and there\u2019s been a lot of vision of people being on the roofs of their cars and some really dangerous situations where my SES volunteers have been placed in danger.

But \u2026 we\u2019ve learned from past disasters to make sure that we are better at addressing the ways that we deal with natural disasters. And I want to thank the federal government for the work that they do. We have an incredible relationship and looked at what we could have done better from the 2020 floods and built that into it.

He says the SES has performed about 200 flood rescues since Friday.  It\u2019s fairly blue skies behind me, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the water danger is over. That the threat of flood is over. As we talked about yesterday, there\u2019s a thing called the blue sky flood, where all of the water that feeds into the tributaries, into the local catchment areas basically comes together. We\u2019ve been quite fortunate in the sense that today we can say that, you know, we didn\u2019t need to close the Windsor Bridge, which is a really fantastic thing for the local community, but also speaks to the volumes of what are flooding could have been where we\u2019re standing right now.

The pipeline is owned by Esso, an ExxonMobil subsidiary. The company notified the regulatory on Saturday morning after a \u201csheen\u201d was visible on the ocean\u2019s surface. Whish-Wilson called on the regulatory to undertake an urgent investigation:  The current regulatory framework doesn\u2019t provide sufficient environmental or economic protection from impacts of the offshore oil and gas sector \u2013 including impacts relating to the decommissioning of ageing and toxic offshore oil and gas rigs. NOPSEMA is supposed to have oversight and regulate the environmental management of the offshore fossil fuel industry, but coastal communities are fast losing confidence in the \u2018independent\u2019 regulator, which has become more of an enabler than an investigator of offshore oil and gas projects. Big fossil fuel corporations make millions from Australia\u2019s offshore oil and gas fields and repeatedly get away with failing to clean up after themselves.

Louise Morris, offshore oil and gas campaign manager, said little was known about the incident as Esso has not commented publicly.  But from information available, she said it was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d there was no clarity on how much petroleum condensate and decommissioning cleaning chemicals had been released into the water.  What we do know from Esso\u2019s statement to the regulator is that there is a \u2018sheen\u2019 on the ocean surface which is exactly what you\u2019d expect to see from a petroleum condensate spill from a pipeline rupture. This \u2018sheen\u2019 is now travelling through the ocean between Tasmania and Victoria through endangered Blue Whale habitat and countless other rare and threatened species, doing harm as it disperses into the ocean environment. In recent years we have seen NOPSEMA inspections of offshore gas operations go down, prosecutions in the case of incidents like this going down, while safety issues have gone up and environmental damage is going up.        3.47am BST       Ruptured gas pipeline being managed \u2018appropriately\u2019, regulator says The offshore oil and gas regulator has confirmed it has been notified about a ruptured gas pipeline off the Victorian coast. A spokesperson for the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA) confirmed it was notified by Esso, an ExxonMobil subsidiary, on Saturday morning about a \u201csheen on the surface of the sea\u201d south-east of the West Kingfish platform. The source of the sheen was believed to be a sea floor pipeline connecting that facility to the Kingfish A platform.  The pipeline \u2013 which was reported to contain 95% water at the time \u2013 has been isolated at both facility ends and is being depressurised. The facility has been offline for four weeks and continues to be so.  The spokesperson did not elaborate on what the remaining 5% of fluid within the pipeline contained. The regulator says it is \u201ccontent\u201d that Esso is \u201ccurrently managing the incident appropriately\u201d saying:  As the investigation is ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment more at this stage.

As of 11am on Sunday, there were 31 properties damaged, 21 buildings which had been inundated and seven that have been found to be uninhabitable.  We\u2019re asking the public to, if they do have damage, report it through to the NSW SES. If there are vulnerable people or elderly people who needed assistance, please give us a call for assistance.  Flood waters at North Richmond overnight peaked at major flood levels and are expected to remain at moderate levels until the water subsides. Windsor Bridge is open but may close if there are further rises.  There are still a number of warnings in place despite the sun being out, there\u2019s still a lot of flooding and it will take a few days for the river levels to reduce below warning levels. We\u2019re not out of the woods yet, but it\u2019s improving.     Updated at 2.54am BST     2.19am BST    Federal government to provide disaster funding for flood-affected areas    Acting federal minister for emergency management Catherine King says disaster support has been activated for those affected by the flooding that has hit parts of Sydney overnight.    Disaster assistance is now available in the Blue Mountains, Camden, Hawkesbury, Kiama, Liverpool, Penrith, Shellharbour, Shoalhaven, Sutherland, Upper Lachlan, Wingecarribee, Wollondilly and Wollongong local government areas. King said it was important to ensure support was delivered quickly so \u201caffected communities can begin their clean-up and recovery\u201d.  I want to thank those who have worked hard to start the clean-up efforts so quickly and I want to assure those whose lives have been disrupted that we will support them through their recovery. The NSW government is continuing to assess the damage and fully understand the impact of this disaster, and the Australian government stands ready to respond to any requests for assistance.  The support includes:  Funding for affected local councils to help with the costs of cleaning up and restoring damaged essential public assets. Assistance for eligible residents to help meet immediate needs like emergency accommodation or small cash payments to buy essential items generally provided from evacuation or recovery centres. Grants for eligible residents to replace lost essential household items to maintain basic standard of living. Grants for eligible residents to undertake essential structural repairs to restore their homes to a safe and habitable condition. Concessional interest rate loans for small businesses, primary producers, sporting and recreation clubs, and nonprofit organisations to repair or replace damaged or destroyed property. Freight subsidies for primary producers to help transport livestock and fodder.

Fern Cadman, fossil fuel campaigner from the Wilderness Society, said blame for the incident lay with the regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema).  The oil and gas industry has a $60bn and rising clean up bill on its hands, and is doing everything it can to avoid getting it done. It doesn\u2019t want to spend the money and it doesn\u2019t want these costs sitting on balance sheets. Unless regulators start using a big stick, this mess will only get worse, and it\u2019s taxpayers, workers and the environment that will bear the costs. Yesterday\u2019s suspected pipeline rupture in the Bass Strait is deeply concerning, especially when we are seeing companies like Esso and Santos claiming that existing pipelines can be \u201crepurposed\u201d for future carbon pollution dumping \u2013 or carbon capture and storage as this industry calls it. Nopsema must not allow carbon pollution dumping proposals to act as a front to avoid decommissioning. It is vital for Nopsema to shake off a history of woeful enforcement when it comes to decommissioning and actually hold companies to account for cleaning up their mess.

The rupture is believed to have occurred at 1pm on Saturday with the Kingfish West gas platform that sits off the coast between Victoria and Tasmania. Kingfish West is operated by Esso, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, which has been working to decommission the ageing platform by leaving it in place. The Australian Workers Union warned in September 2022 that the company was \u201ccutting corners\u201d in how it was planning to deal with the infrastructure.    Updated at 1.31am BST     1.10am BST    Sydney floods: more than 350 homes subject to evacuation orders    The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, is expected to declare a natural disaster after heavy rain caused flooding across parts of Sydney with thousands evacuated from their homes by State Emergency Services. The SES says that while the flood threat is easing, 352 homes are affected by evacuation orders. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, Minns said:  Federal and state funds will flow to local councils, as well as to communities that have been knocked over, particularly those that have lost their houses, or those in a peril over the last 28 hours. So that should happen later this morning.  Evacuation orders remain in place for several areas including, parts of Agnes Banks, Freemans Reach, north of Bligh Park and the Western Richmond Lowlands due to moderate flooding in North Richmond and minor flooding occurring in Penrith. Speaking to Nine\u2019s Weekend Today, NSW State Emergency Services Ch Supt Dallas Burnes said while the flood threat was easing, the clean up will be \u201csignificant\u201d.  We have seen the highest peak and we\u2019re now following that water downstream and making sure we warn the communities in its path. The clean-up [will be] significant \u2026 you can\u2019t stop a flood, it\u2019s not like a fire where you can send appliances and defend a dwelling \u2013 we\u2019ve really just got to make sure we get people and their livestock out of harms way.  The rain on Friday and Saturday earlier caused landslips, flash flooding and a house in Wollongong to be swept into a creek. Witnesses reported seeing two people emerge from the mangled home in Mount Keira. Investigations on Sunday will also continue into the death of a man found in water in Penrith. The man, whose death was not attributed to a cause, was located by a passer-by about 7.30am on Saturday.

Valiant attempt by David Speers to get Simon Birmingham to answer questions (repeatedly rebuffed) about whether Israel needs to do more to avoid civilian deaths in Gaza &quot;Let me ask you one more time...&quot;(Rough Tveeder transcript) pic.twitter.com/QULhl4I7yJ&mdash; Josh Butler (@JoshButler) April 6, 2024     When asked about Israel, the Senator consistently responded by speaking about Hamas       12.39am BST       \u2018There are enormous complexities\u2019: Birmingham on Australian in Syrian jail Birmingham is asked about the case of Yusuf Zahab, who was 12 when his family took him to live under Islamic State in Syria in 2015. He has now been found in a Syrian jail by SBS Dateline where he has been detained without charge.    The senator is asked about whether Australia should be trying to bring him home:  There are enormous complexities when it comes to the situation in Syria. Complexities in terms of safety, access, and the type of diplomatic relations that don\u2019t exist, not just faced by Australia, but Canada as well and beyond those complexities there are the security assessments in relation to individuals who have spent a lot time embedded with Islamic State fighters and the threats posed there. On this particular case, the opposition has not had briefings from the government about this individual and his circumstances, so it\u2019s the government to speak as to what they know and what could or couldn\u2019t be done. We understand the breakdown of complexities \u2013 the breadth of complexities and to ensure that Australia and Australian officials are kept safe in the circumstances.     Updated at 12.55am BST     12.37am BST       Birmingham on new boat of asylum seekers in WA Birmingham is asked about a new boat of asylum seekers which has landed in northern Western Australia and specifically whether Chinese people seeking protection should be placed into a special category. The senator says \u201cconsideration of protection is done according to the legal frameworks around refugee environments\u201d. He then turns to attacking the government, noting that \u201cthis is the third boat since November that appears to have made it to the mainland\u201d.    Updated at 12.43am BST     12.35am BST       China providing security at Pacific Island Forum would be a concern: Birmingham Birmingham is asked about a government decision to potentially share security arrangements for the Pacific Island Forum and says \u201cwe should be expecting the security is provided by forum countries\u201d.  If there is a suggestion that China will provide that security or other logistics, I think it would be a concern to many PIF member nations. The Albanese government needs to be clear as to how it has come to this and what steps it is making to make sure Tonga is provided with all the necessary support so that PIF member nations are providing logistics for those PIF meetings.     Updated at 12.41am BST     12.33am BST       \u2018Israel needs to take greater care with the protection of civilian lives\u2019: Birmingham Birmingham has been repeatedly asked about whether Israel should \u201ctake more care when it comes to protection of civilian lives in Gaza\u201d. Each time has responded by speaking about Hamas. When the Senator is asked for a third time, he says:  Israel needs to take greater care with the protection of civilian lives.  Birmingham is then asked what he means by \u201cgreater care\u201d.  Consistent with its obligations under international law as we have said from October 8 onwards. There was not \u2026  Asked a fourth time, Birmingham said:  Clearly, when mistakes like the one that has just occurred, and other mistakes have hand as they do in war, Israel should learn from each mistakes and making necessary changes and procedures to ensure that it is applying as safe an environment as possible for humanitarian workers, the protection of civilians, who receive warnings, are provided with advice but of course, it is upon Israel in terms of the eyes of the world to act with regard to international law a standard far higher than that applied, tragically, to a terrorist organisation. That\u2019s why that terrorist organisation needs to be removed from any position of influence, governance or threat, such that we can move into a more peaceful negotiation environment.     Updated at 12.38am BST     12.30am BST       Mistakes \u2018happen all the time\u2019 in war: Birmingham Birmingham says it is \u201cnaive for any of us to pretend\u201d that \u201cmistakes and tragedies do not happen in war\u201d.  They happen all the time. It\u2019s terrible. We wish it weren\u2019t the case. In this relation, we seek to engage with Israel and we expect the government to engage with Israel to understand how accountability can be had for the mistake that occurred and how it can be prevented through changes to procedures.  A reminder that the three cars that formed the aid convoy that was struck by the IDF in Gaza was hit sequentially after the aid organisation notified the IDF they intended to travel through the area and received assurances they could do so safely.    Updated at 12.35am BST     12.25am BST       Birmingham \u2018not qualified\u2019 to say if Israel has breached international law Asked about whether he believes the Israeli government has breached international law, Birmingham says he is \u201cnot qualified nor in possession of the facts to give that legal judgment\u201d.  What I will respect are the processes under way. We want to make sure they are transparent and they are fully addressing the two pillars I have spoken about, in relation to accountability around the incident and changes to procedures to ensure that it is not repeated again. None of us should lose sight of the broader moral context in which the war is fought.  The senator has then repeated frequent criticisms levelled by the Israeli government that has accused Hamas of \u201cembedding itself\u201d into civilian infrastructure.    Updated at 12.34am BST     12.24am BST       \u2018Not the only tragedy\u201d: Birmingham on Zomi Fankcom death Birmingham says that the Israel government is following its processes and the opposition will reserve judgments until its investigations are included.  Our expectation is to see Israel continue the investigations they have under way, to use the processes that they have, and for there to be transparency around that. There are two issues. One relates to accountability for this incident and the other relates to changes to procedure to ensure that other workers \u2013 this is notthe only tragedy involving humanitarian workers \u2013 and not the only tragedy to have occurred in many other conflicts involving aid workers.  Birmingham says \u201cthere is a responsibility on Israel to make changes to their procedures to prevent such tragedies from happening again.\u201d    Updated at 12.31am BST     12.22am BST       Coalition wants to see \u2018clear action\u2019 on Zomi Frankcom investigation The opposition shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, says that the Coalition wants to see \u201cclear action in terms of understanding\u201d how the death of Zomi Frankcom occurred.  We want to see there is clear action in terms of understanding how the tragedy will occur, importantly, how it will not occur again, because seeing humanitarian aid flowing into Gaza requires humanitarian workers to operate safely and that requires Israel to clearly to look carefully at procedural failure that occurred that enabled this tragedy to happen.  Birmingham said the decision of the Israeli government to stand down two officers and reprimand three commanders \u201cshows accountability.\u201d  There are continuing processes, I understand. I had conversations with Israel\u2019s ambassador to Australia, to ensure that we understand the steps that are being taken. Of course, the government has a higher level of dialogue with the Israel government.     Updated at 12.27am BST     12.10am BST       Coalition has misjudged gravity of Gaza war: Husic The federal Labor minister, Ed Husic, has accused the Coalition of misjudging the gravity of the moment, including the need for the west to \u201cdemonstrate our values\u201d by insisting that Israel observes the laws of war. Husic said the Australian government had called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza since December when it backed a resolution at the UN general assembly along with 152 other countries. Husic said Hamas must also release the Israeli hostages that it still holds in order to make any ceasefire \u201cdurable\u201d. Husic told Sky News today:  I think there\u2019s another element to this as well. The other element is: where\u2019s the Coalition on this? Because, frankly, the Coalition has not brought itself to be able to express its concern either to people domestically who are deeply worried about the way in which the tragic loss of life [has unfolded] and the number of people killed in this operation. But the other point I would make is in the international landscape, this is the most contestable it has been in decades. And the worst thing for the west is a perception of hypocrisy when it comes to crises like this. We need to be able to demonstrate our values, and in particular our defence of international humanitarian law. And the Coalition has been utterly silent on this, or at other times been very weak, particularly this week, in acknowledging that Israel crossed a line, and that Zomi Frankcom paid the price for the crossing of that line.  The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said on Wednesday that it was \u201ca tragic circumstance where an aid worker has lost her life in a very difficult war zone\u201d but said the loss of life in the Middle East at the moment was \u201ca direct result of Hamas\u2019 attacks on the 7th of October\u201d. Dutton said:  Obviously, nobody wants to see conflict of any circumstance in the Middle East, but it is a reality, and our thoughts, our prayers and condolences obviously go out to Zomi\u2019s family and to her friends and to those who are there serving at the moment, in harm\u2019s way, trying to provide support to people who are in a very difficult situation.     Updated at 12.15am BST     11.57pm BST       IDF attack on aid vehicles \u2018a grave mistake\u2019: Ed Husic The Israeli military on Friday night published a summary of initial findings, saying the strike on the aid vehicles on Monday was \u201ca grave mistake\u201d stemming from a serious failure due to a mistaken identification, errors in decision-making, and an attack contrary to the standard operating procedures. Asked whether he accepted the incident in which Australian Zomi Frankcom was killed as accidental, the Labor minister Ed Husic said:  It would be, if I may say, it would be the easiest route to use the bad apples defence here, that it was a couple of people that operated outside of policy.  The IDF announced that a major and a colonel would be dismissed from their positions, while three others would be formally reprimanded. But Husic told Sky News today:  I believe this reflects a systematic failure within the Israeli government to genuinely commit to the observance of international humanitarian law. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen 33,000 Palestinians killed, 14,500 of which are children, and 77,000 injured. And then on top of that, 200 aid workers [and] 100 journalists. I mean, this comes down to a failure by the Israeli government to observe international law distinguishing between combatant and civilian.  Husic said the plan to announce a special adviser to the Australian government to provide advice on the investigation was \u201ca very big step by our government\u201d. He said the government wanted Australians \u201cto have the confidence that we get to the bottom of what\u2019s happened\u201d and ensure full transparency and full accountability.    Updated at 12.11am BST     11.48pm BST    Killing of Gaza aid workers by IDF reflects 'systematic failure': Ed Husic    The federal industry minister, Ed Husic, says the killing of aid workers \u2013 including the Australian citizen Zomi Frankcom \u2013 in Gaza \u201creflects a systematic failure within the Israeli government to genuinely commit to the observance of international humanitarian law\u201d. Husic told Sky News this morning:  In terms of Zomi, she dedicated herself to help the lives of others - she shouldn\u2019t have lost her life in pursuit of that ambition. This has clearly deeply resonated in a number of countries where in particular seven aid workers lost their lives in once incident, but unfortunately Zomi joins nearly 200 humanitarian workers who have lost their lives in this conflict. This is not a small thing because it goes to the heart of concerns that have persisted around observance of international humanitarian law. You cannot target humanitarian workers. You cannot target journalists. You cannot target schools, hospitals. You\u2019ve got a responsibility under international humanitarian law to distinguish clearly between combatants and civilians and protect civilians.  The Israeli government has repeatedly accused Hamas of embedding itself in civilian infrastructure.

", "Myanmar: is the junta\u2019s grip on power weakening and what next for its leadership? [2024-04-10T00:41:09Z]": "Myanmar\u2019s military junta is on the brink of losing control of a major trading town, Myawaddy, on its eastern border with Thailand, after soldiers defending the position surrendered in recent days, according to opposition groups. This is the latest in a series of defeats for the junta, which has also lost crucial territory along its border with China and India, as well as areas of Rakhine state, in the west of the country. These defeats aren\u2019t just economic or strategic blows for the junta \u2013 they\u2019re also a humiliation for the generals. Such developments have been celebrated by the wider pro-democracy movement, and provoked anger among the military ranks, raising questions about how long the junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing, can survive. Who is fighting against the Myanmar military and why? The military seized power in a coup three years ago, ousting the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and causing outrage among the public, who took to the streets to protest. The military responded with brutal crackdowns and many civilians took up arms and joined people\u2019s defence forces to fight against junta rule \u2013 often with little weaponry or resources.   Related: Myanmar opposition carries out drone attack on capital    Some of these groups have received support from older, more experienced ethnic armed organisations that have fought with the military for decades to achieve independence for their people. These group\u2019s specific goals, and the extent to which they are coordinated, varies. However, the sheer number of different groups fighting the military, across various parts of the country, has left the generals severely overstretched. In a sign of how lacking in manpower the military is, it recently imposed mandatory conscription \u2013 a policy that has caused young people to flee military-controlled areas. Is the military losing its grip on power? The military has lost control of many important border areas and it appears unlikely it will be able to regain much territory soon. It still retains control of the centre of the country, including the big cities of Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyidaw. \u201cThe military has been humiliated time after time after time and suffered significant losses. Clearly, there\u2019s a very deep rot at the heart of the institution and its ability to project power,\u201d says Richard Horsey, Myanmar adviser to Crisis Group, a non-profit that produces analysis of conflicts around the world. \u201cIt isn\u2019t, at the moment, collapsing as an institution. This isn\u2019t the fall of Kabul.\u201d    However, what happens next isn\u2019t simply a matter of how much ground the military has lost on the battlefield, says Horsey \u2013 it\u2019s also about the psychological impact such relentless defeats are having on the institution, and the political ramifications in the capital, Naypyidaw. There is a possibility of \u201cregime implosion of some kind, or the implosion of [junta chief] Min Aung Hlaing\u2019s leadership,\u201d he says. \u201cIt just seems that it can\u2019t go on like this forever.\u201d There is no clear protocol for changing leadership within the military, and any new leader may be even more brutal than Min Aung Hlaing, whose military has been repeatedly accused of indiscriminate shelling and airstrikes, torching homes and mass killings.Any new military leader would face an uphill battle: morale is extremely low, thousands have defected and it is fighting a multitude of opponents. How are regional countries responding? The regional bloc, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, has led international efforts to resolve the crisis in Myanmar, but with no success. The Thai prime minister, Srettha Thavisin, told Reuters this week that now was a good time to open talks with Myanmar as the military regime was weakening.   Related: Blow for Myanmar\u2019s military as rebels say hundreds have surrendered at key border town    But military generals, who are loathed by the public and accused of war crimes, appear highly unlikely to negotiate. The National Unity Government, which was set up to oppose the junta, \u201chas made it very clear that they\u2019re open to talks only on the condition of the military\u2019s willing to surrender control. So it seems like a non starter,\u201d says Hunter Marston, adjunct research fellow at La Trobe Asia in Melbourne. China is considered the country most likely to be able to influence events in Myanmar \u2013 though there are limits to this, and relations between China and the military are complex. China was displeased by the coup, which came at a time when it had established warm relations with Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government and had investments in the country. The coup has brought chaos and instability. China has also grown increasingly frustrated about the proliferation of online scam centres in Myanmar that target Chinese nationals, a lucrative criminal activity the military has failed to halt. Anger over this issue apparently led China to give its tacit approval to a powerful bloc of ethnic armed groups to launch a coordinated offensive against the military in northern Shan state late last year, leading to a major defeat for the military. China has since mediated ceasefire agreements in the area. China has long been cultivating ties with all stakeholders in Myanmar, Marston says. Ultimately, it \u201cdoes still see a divided and weak subservient Myanmar as ideal, even if it undermines China\u2019s business interests in the country\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t want to have sort of a western-leaning, liberal democracy on its border.\u201d", "Afternoon Update: Penny Wong\u2019s comments spark debate; AFL player suspended over homophobic slur; and an instant coffee taste test [2024-04-10T07:06:19Z]": "Welcome, readers, to Afternoon Update. \nPenny Wong\u2019s speech floating Australia\u2019s possible support for Palestinian statehood came under fire today. \nSome commentators have interpreted the Australian foreign minister\u2019s speech on Tuesday evening to the Australian National University national security conference as a hint that Australia could recognise Palestinian statehood in the near term, although Wong has clarified that the government has made no such decision. \nThe shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, labelled Wong\u2019s stance \u201cdownright dangerous\u201d while the Executive Council of Australian Jewry called the speech \u201cimmensely disappointing\u201d. \nThe president of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network, Nasser Mashni, said he welcomed Wong\u2019s support for the recognition of Palestine, but said it was \u201conly the beginning of the work Australia needs to do to contribute to the breaking of this 76-year history of Israeli violence against, and oppression of, Palestinians\u201d. \nTop news \n \n Netanyahu making a \u2018mistake\u2019 on Gaza, says Biden | The US president has said Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s approach on Gaza was a \u201cmistake\u201d and urged Israel to call for a ceasefire, in an interview that aired on Tuesday.

Zesty optimism has been a signature trait during her tenure as Melbourne\u2019s lord mayor, but it hasn\u2019t always won her plaudits. In a 2022 TEDx talk she declared the Covid-19 pandemic had been good for Melbourne, saying the city had emerged bruised but also bolder and braver than before. Business owners decried the comments after the city\u2019s emergence from one of the world\u2019s longest series of lockdowns. But ask the departing city leader how the term \u201cpandemic mayor\u201d sits with her and there is no hesitation.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cI\u2019m completely comfortable with that. It\u2019s a shared experience,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though we\u2019re the city with one of the longest days in lockdowns, the mark of our character is how we responded during those lockdowns, during the bounce backs. What we see today, that trajectory is truly admirable and exciting.\u201d Capp, Melbourne\u2019s first directly elected female mayor, will leave the role in June after six years. At 56, she cites wanting to explore new opportunities and having given her all to the role as reasons for the departure, noting she had spent all of her 50s at town hall. Capp will hand the reins over to the deputy lord mayor, Nicholas Reece, who is widely expected to run for the top job. Her tenure has at times been subject to bitter criticism in the conservative media and on social media. Capp won a 2018 byelection when town hall was engulfed in scandal after her predecessor, Robert Doyle, resigned after allegations of sexual harassment. The city she helmed during those dark days is recovering. In the first two months of the year, Melbourne city recorded its highest foot traffic since 2015, largely driven by major events like Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour.    Capp has championed the city\u2019s new rhythm, with Friday and the weekends now the most popular times in the CBD, exceeding pre-pandemic foot traffic levels. But challenges remain \u2013 enticing city office workers back on Mondays and Fridays has proved difficult. During the prolonged lockdowns, Capp faced criticism from Melbourne\u2019s business sector for not pushing back enough on the lockdowns imposed by the Andrews government, due to the crippling impact on city traders. Capp points to joint initiatives with the state government, an initial $100m Melbourne city recovery fund and a further $200m revitalisation fund \u2013 including a voucher scheme to support CBD businesses \u2013 as examples of how council fought for the city\u2019s devastated businesses. \u201cThere\u2019s still work to do, absolutely,\u201d she says. \u201cWe see that in the news every day, it\u2019s in my emails, it\u2019s in the conversations in the streets\u201d Capp, the former Victorian head of the Property Council of Australia, had a trail-blazing career in the business sector prior to running for public office. She acknowledges she was politically naive when she was elected mayor, but says it allowed her to commence the role without a jaded perspective. The council\u2019s rollout of CBD bike lanes \u2013 paused in 2022 \u2013 has been dubbed a \u201cwar on cars\u201d due to the loss of road and parking space, while Capp\u2019s use of a private limousine \u2013 totalling more than $30,000 in ratepayers funds \u2013 has sparked fierce media coverage. During her walks through the city and meetings with stakeholders, Capp fields questions on an array of council matters but describes the conversations as a \u201cchallenge to improve\u201d when there is disagreement. \u201cMost of the vitriol comes from people sitting a long way away from the reality, or armchair commentators or professional commentators, and I don\u2019t see the value of that type of commentary and criticism,\u201d she says.    She acknowledges the vitriol is one of the hardest parts of her job. \u201cI won\u2019t say it doesn\u2019t hurt. It hurts. But they\u2019re flesh wounds,\u201d she says. \u201cI think a lot of what I\u2019ve received is very gendered, even commenting on what I look like, things that are beyond an issue or a project that are very personal.\u201d \u201cSome of the tenor or the tone, the innuendo those sorts of things have been very unfair but what\u2019s really disappointing is they actually distract from the issue.\u201d Reece, who previously worked as a senior adviser to Julia Gillard, draws parallels between the gendered treatment of the former prime minister and Capp. \u201cI\u2019ve seen first-hand the specific challenges that women face in senior political roles,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of these issues I\u2019ve seen again with Sally Capp\u201d Announcing her resignation last week, Capp singled out several major projects as her legacy \u2013 the Queen Victoria Market redevelopment, the Greenline project and Make Room \u2013 the conversion of a council-owned building into homelessness accommodation and support services \u2013 but all are yet to be finished. The completion date and funding remains unclear for the $316m Greenline, a planned 4km of interconnected promenades and parks on the north bank of the Yarra River. But Capp says she is proud to have overseen projects that will \u201cgo beyond my time\u201d and \u201chaven\u2019t just been focused on short-term initiatives to fit in with an election cycles\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually been making decisions that are good for the city even if we know that we won\u2019t get to have a photo, or cut a ribbon,\u201d she says. Capp\u2019s successor will face what she describes as the \u201cdeep\u201d to-do list in office. How they steer the unfinished projects is likely to define Capp\u2019s stamp on the city.", "Morning Mail: Israel strike on Damascus, Aukus nuclear waste fears, and airlines on notice over \u2018greenwashing\u2019 [2024-04-01T19:59:20Z]": "Morning everyone.

Speaking in Canberra, the prime minister said Mostyn, who will be the 28th governor general and the second woman to hold the role, will be sworn in on July 1. \n   The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service (Vals) has slammed the state government\u2019s response to a report by the Indigenous-truth telling commission into reform to overhaul the child protection and criminal justice systems.

Industry experts welcomed the move, saying it could educate more road users about the importance of vehicle chargers, but they also warned it could take months before fines are issued. \n  The new parking offences, which were gazetted by the government in November last year, will attract on-the-spot fines of $75 in the first instance and $111 for repeated infringements. \n  Fines will be issued to drivers of diesel and petrol-powered cars who park their vehicle in clearly signposted electric vehicle charging bays, as well as EV drivers who park in the spaces but do not use the charger provided. \n  -AAP. \n  \n Updated at 8.03am BST \n \n \n  7.40am BST  \n  \n  Julia Gillard issues congratulations to new governor general Sam Mostyn  \n  Former Labor prime ministers are lining up to get behind the appointment of Sam Mostyn: First Paul Keating, now Julia Gillard. \n   \n   \n    pic.twitter.com/6OrTE2DLOw\u2014 Julia Gillard (@JuliaGillard) April 3, 2024\n    \n   \n  One question remains.

Sydney will get three days of drenching as the trough sweeps through, with up to 25mm on Thursday, up to 100mm on Friday, and up to 50mm on Saturday. \n  The BoM has warned flooding could hit Sydney and coastal NSW on Saturday, with particularly strong floods possible along the Hawkesbury-Nepean River from late Friday. \n  NSW\u2019s SES is moving its volunteers from the state\u2019s west towards the east coast, to back up their Sydney and coastal colleagues. \u201cMost of our eastern coastline is going to be operational with this potential weather system,\u201d spokesperson Stephanie Heard said. \n  Heard said the NSW SES is well-prepared to support communities but warned residents against entering floodwaters. \n   \n   We\u2019re really urging people at the moment to never ride, walk or drive through any floodwaters \u2026 It\u2019s just not worth the risk. \n   \n  The weather system drenched Victoria before sweeping north into Queensland earlier this week.

The research painted a picture of future droughts in Australia that were far worse than any from recent years. \n  Modelling co-author Georgy Falster said megadroughts were part of the natural variations in Australia\u2019s climate, but human-induced changes were probably making the prospect of such an extreme event more likely. \n   \n   The combination of climate change on top of naturally occurring megadroughts that could last for 20 years means that, in the future, Australia could see droughts that are worse than anything in recent history. \n   \n  -AAP. \n  \n Updated at 6.43am BST \n \n \n  6.23am BST  \n  \n  Tributes have continued to pour in for aid worker Zomi Frankcom after she was killed in Gaza, including from politicians across the political divide. \n  The foreign minister, Penny Wong, this afternoon laid flowers for Frankcom alongside Australian non-government organisations. \n   \n   \n    This afternoon I joined representatives from Australian NGOs to lay flowers for Zomi Frankcom at the monument to commemorate the sacrifices of Australia\u2019s humanitarian workers.Zomi will not be forgotten. pic.twitter.com/NfHtWaZBH1\u2014 Senator Penny Wong (@SenatorWong) April 3, 2024\n    \n   \n  Her note reads: \n   \n   For Zomi, Your commitment to humanity will not be forgotten.

An innocent, young Australian has been killed in terrible circumstances and we will continue to press the Israeli government for the satisfactory outcome of the situation. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.24am BST \n \n \n  6.04am BST  \n  \n  First free Australian multi-day pill testing service wraps at Rabbits Eat Lettuce music festival \n  Australia\u2019s first multi-day pill testing service has been successfully completed, with hundreds of festival-goers tested over the Easter long weekend. \n  The pill testing service, made available at Queensland\u2019s Rabbits Eat Lettuce festival, forms part of a $1m state government commitment to fund and evaluate drug checking services over the next two years. \n  Some 257 festivalgoers had their substances tested for free by a qualified chemist over the four day event. They also met with a harm reduction worker as part of the service, who provided information on the dangers of drug use. \n  The average age of patrons who visited the service at the festival were between 28 and 30 years old. \n  Of the 210 samples provided, approximately 14 were discarded. The most common substances presented for testing were MDMA and ketamine. \n  Queensland\u2019s minister for health, mental health and ambulance services Shannon Fentiman said there was \u201cno safe way to take illicit drugs\u201d - but harm could be reduced. \n   \n   In 2021, there were over 2,200 drug-related deaths in Australia, which is 2,200 too many. That is why this initiative is important. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.08am BST \n \n \n  5.49am BST  \n  \n  Humanitarian agencies issue joint statement condemning rising aid worker death toll in Gaza \n  Australian humanitarian agencies have endorsed a joint statement condemning the rising aid worker death toll in Gaza following the Israeli airstrike that killed seven people working for the World Central Kitchen. \n  Caritas Australia, Oxfam Australia, Union Aid Abroad-APHEDA, Save the Children Australia, ActionAid Australia, Plan International Australia, Care Australia and the Australian Council for International Development urged the federal government to use all diplomatic means available to ensure Israel complied with international humanitarian law \u2013 including support for a permanent ceasefire. \n  The bodies said at its \u201cmost basic level\u201d, humanitarian law demands \u201crapid and unimpeded humanitarian access, freedom of movement for humanitarian workers, and the protection of civilians including medical and aid workers\u201d. \n   \n   It also demands the protection of refugees, prisoners, the wounded and sick. \n   \n  Caritas Australia\u2019s CEO, Kirsty Robertson, said inside Gaza civilians were experiencing \u201csuffering on a mass scale\u201d. \n   \n   The psychological toll of this conflict is set to leave an unprecedented and tragic legacy on Gaza\u2019s young population, over half of whom are under 15 years old. Protecting humanitarians as they try to alleviate some of this suffering is the bare minimum that we should expect as international community, and a human family. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.55am BST \n \n \n  5.39am BST  \n  \n  Aged care peak body welcomes reform delay as chance to \u2018get this right\u2019 \n  Continued from previous post: \n  The Aged &amp; Community Care Providers Association (ACCPA) has welcomed the opportunity to provide continued input into the act. \n  Tom Symondson, the CEO of the industry peak body, says it is a \u201cchance to usher in a new era to reform our aged care system\u201d: \n   \n   We need to make sure that the legislation, which will likely govern the aged care sector for the next 30 years, is not rushed. We need to get this right. \n   We of course want to see the legislation passed and implemented as soon as practical. But this allows more time to engage meaningfully with older people, the community, the sector and other stakeholders. \n   It is far more important that the legislation and associated requirements be passed when it is ready, than passed to meet the 1 July date. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.47am BST \n \n \n  5.38am BST  \n  \n  Aged care reforms potentially delayed past 1 July commitment \n  Aged care minister Anika Wells says the government is taking more time to consider a new Aged Care Act, potentially pushing out the 1 July timeline that had previously been committed to. \n  The minister says the major new reform is one that \u201cwe must get right\u201d. The government now doesn\u2019t expect to have the act, updating laws from 1997, passed before 1 July - but is confident that the reforms will be made public later this year. \n  It\u2019s understood that public comments on drafts and consultation sessions had been more fulsome than expected. Combined with only four parliament sitting weeks until July, including one week for the budget, it\u2019s unlikely the major reforms will be passed before that time. \n  In a statement today, Wells thanked \u201cthe older people, their families and carers, workers, advocates and aged care providers who shared their feedback on the draft new Aged Care Act\u201d. \n   \n   We heard strong feedback that the proposed new Aged Care Act is a once in a generation opportunity for systemic reform that we must get right. \n   The government is now considering the extensive and valuable feedback to refine and finalise the draft legislation before it is introduced to parliament. We will update the commencement date of the legislation following these updates and before the bill is introduced to the parliament. \n   \n  The minister said the government is \u201ccommitted to working with all members of parliament to implement these reforms\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 5.42am BST \n \n \n  5.30am BST  \n  \n  A travel company and a Melbourne school have been charged over the death of a student who became unwell on a school trip. \n  Lachlan Cook, 16, a student at Kilvington Grammar, suffered diabetes complications during a trip to Vietnam in September 2019 and later died in a Melbourne hospital. His death was found to have been preventable by a coroner in 2023. \n  A court previously heard the boy had been self-managing his type 1 diabetes when he fell ill and was taken to hospital 24 hours after first showing symptoms. \n  On Wednesday, it was revealed WorkSafe has charged both the school and travel company. \n  World Travel Expeditions has been charged with three counts of failing to ensure that persons other than employees were not exposed to health and safety risks under the Occupational Health and Safety Act. \n  The regulator alleges the company failed, so far as was reasonably practicable, to reduce the risk of illness or death to participating students, including those with diabetes. \n  The school is also facing one charge under the health and safety law. \n  - AAP. \n  \n Updated at 5.32am BST \n \n \n  5.20am BST  \n NT announces funding for additional police recruitment \n  \n  The Northern Territory government has announced funding to recruit an additional 200 police officers in a bid to \u201cdeliver more police on our streets than ever before\u201d. \n  It comes midway into a curfew in Alice Springs preventing young people from leaving their homes between 6pm and 6am that has been criticised by the Northern Territory Police Association (NTPA) as possibly being unlawful. \n  The 200 extra officers will be recruited over the next four years, in addition to the current target of 1,642 officers in the Northern Territory police force. \n  The chief minister, Eva Lawler, said the investment in new police was the biggest commitment by any government in the Territory. \n   \n   Nothing is more important than keeping Territorians safe \u2013 and that\u2019s why my government will deliver more police on our streets than ever before. \n   Investing more in the Northern Territory police force so they can have the right amount of officers available to combat crime each day is a key plank of my commonsense plan to lower crime. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.37am BST \n \n \n  5.05am BST  \n  \n  Jewish community organisations say death of aid workers in Israeli drone strike \u2018a tragedy\u2019 but \u2018ultimately the responsibility of Hamas\u2019 \n  Jewish community organisations in Australia have responded after Israel confirmed it had killed seven aid workers, including the Australian citizen aid worker Lalzawmi \u201cZomi\u201d Frankcom, in Gaza on Monday. \n  Earlier, we brought you comments from Australian political leaders, including Anthony Albanese, who said he had used a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu this morning to express Australia\u2019s anger and outrage and to demand \u201cfull accountability\u201d. \n  The three cars were struck by Israeli drones when they travelled along a route south of Deir al-Balah pre-approved and coordinated with the Israel Defense Forces. The IDF chief of the general staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said today that the strike was \u201ca grave mistake\u201d that \u201cfollowed a misidentification at night, during a war, in very complex conditions\u201d. \n  The Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-CEO, Alex Ryvchin, expressed \u201ccondolences to Ms Frankcom\u2019s family and all those affected\u201d, saying she was a hero: \n   \n   Those who voluntarily travel to a war zone to help people in need are heroes. Their deaths are an immense tragedy. We support the government\u2019s call for a thorough and transparent investigation to determine how this happened and ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again. \n   \n  Ryvchin said casualties caused by accidental fire were \u201ca grim reality of war especially one involving a ruthless terrorist force that uses unlawful and sinister tactics intended to ensnare the civilian population in the fighting and inflict maximum suffering on non-combatants\u201d. \n  The president of the Zionist Federation of Australia, Jeremy Leibler, said Frankcom was \u201cpart of the vital humanitarian resupply efforts by World Central Kitchen\u201d and described her death as \u201ca tragedy\u201d. Leibler added: \n   \n   The dual tragedy here is that like the innocent Israelis murdered by Hamas on 7 October and the innocent Palestinians since, Ms Frankcom\u2019s death is ultimately the responsibility of Hamas. \n   \n  Earlier, the relatively new Jewish Council of Australia called on the Australian government to \u201cdo everything in its power to stop Israel committing the crime of genocide\u201d and to use \u201call available forms of diplomatic pressure, including sanctions and travel bans on extremist settlers and those suspected of war crimes\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 5.21am BST \n \n \n  4.49am BST  \n  \n  Paul Keating welcomes Sam Mostyn\u2019s appointment as governor general \n  Australia\u2019s next governor general, Sam Mostyn, may be best known as the first woman AFL commissioner and a longstanding gender equity advocate. \n  But earlier in her career, she was also an adviser to former PM Paul Keating.

The Indigenous teen was taken to hospital in a critical condition and later died, causing outrage and grief in the community. \n  Coroner Phil Urquhart said at the start of hearings in Perth on Wednesday there had never been a similar inquest in WA. \n  He said it was the first to be held for a young person who had died by \u201capparent suicide\u201d in a youth detention centre contained in a maximum-security prison built to house adults. \n  The expedited inquest has also included an unprecedented early level of involvement from the coronial investigators, including examining Cleveland\u2019s cell in Unit 18 soon after his death and supervising evidence gathering. \n  Despite this, Urquhart said the inquest would be a limited fact-finding exercise and he could not make findings of negligence or guilt for criminal offences. \n  Cleveland\u2019s mother, Nadene Dodd, said in a statement her family is \u201cstill reeling\u201d from the loss: \n   \n   With each new detail that comes to light about the night he died or about Unit 18 generally, I become more determined to get justice for Cleveland, and for all the other boys sent there. \n   \n  - via AAP \n  \n Updated at 4.47am BST \n \n \n  4.33am BST  \n  \n  I\u2019ll now leave you with Caitlin Cassidy, who will have the blog until this evening.

The government has supported four of the report\u2019s 46 recommendations in full, while 24 have been accepted in principle. \n  Another 15 recommendations are under consideration, including establishing an independent police complaints body. \n  Vals says the government\u2019s response is \u201cunworthy of the heart wrenching truths\u201d the inquiry heard. \n  In a statement, Nerita Waight, the chief executive of Vals, says it is \u201cso disappointing\u201d the government did not develop a \u201cmore detailed response\u201d that supported all the recommendations in full: \n   \n   We have waited over 210 days for the Victorian government to respond to the Yoorrook for justice report and it reads like it was slapped together overnight. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.26am BST \n \n \n  3.52am BST  \n  \n  Dutton hints at Coalition support for blunting domination of big supermarkets \n  Staying with Peter Dutton\u2019s earlier press conference, the opposition leader hinted toward support of new powers to break up the supermarket duopoly under a future Coalition government. \n  The Greens introduced divestiture proposals to the parliament in the recent sitting period, with the aims of breaking up the market power of Coles and Woolworths. The Nationals initially backed the concept, then later clarified that the Liberals and Nationals parties would work together on a divestment structure of their own. \n  Concrete details of that idea haven\u2019t landed yet, but the opposition are believed to want any such powers to focus more tightly on supermarket players rather than broad-ranging powers applying to the whole economy. \n   \n    Related: Watchdog would get powers to \u2018smash\u2019 supermarket duopoly under Greens bill  \n   \n  Asked about the divestiture push today, Dutton didn\u2019t rule it out. \n  He told his press conference: \n   \n   I believe very strongly that if there\u2019s market failure in a particular market and consumers are being adversely impacted \u2013 for example, in a particular geographic region where there was a concentration of Coles or Woolies stores, to the exclusion of those other competitors, and consumers were paying more by way of price \u2013 then I think in that circumstance, you would look at whether or not that market domination would continue. \n   You\u2019ve got a situation now where Coles and Woolies have their own property development arms, they\u2019re purchasing blocks of land so that other competitors can\u2019t build within the vicinity of their existing operations or their planned operations. So, I think there\u2019s a question mark about the appropriateness of that behaviour. Ultimately, we\u2019ve got consumers who are paying through the roof at the moment for items when they turn up to a checkout, and that\u2019s because of the government\u2019s energy policy, because of the decisions the government\u2019s made in two budgets which have forced up inflation. \n   \n  The Nationals have also raised issue with the property development and \u201cland banking\u201d issue, where large companies buy up prime real estate which can stop the entry of new stores. \n  \n Updated at 4.07am BST \n \n \n  3.48am BST  \n Dutton sidesteps questions about exactly where nuclear power stations should go \n  \n  Peter Dutton is still resisting revealing exactly where the Coalition would plan to build nuclear power stations, again sidestepping questions about the key detail of the opposition\u2019s controversial alternative to renewable energy. \n  Dutton has shared only bare details of the plan - which started as a push for small modular reactors, but now may rely on large structures. The Australian newspaper today reported that the opposition may finally unveil the details, long after first proposing the idea, in the lead to the May 14 budget. \n  Key questions remain about where the plants would be built, how much power they could generate, what it would cost, how much public funding the government would have to pledge to make the projects viable, and what the Coalition would propose to do with the nuclear waste. \n  Asked at a press conference today exactly where the nuclear plants would be built, Dutton quickly launched into a standard tut-tutting of renewables, running through a stump speech about \u201clikely disruption to power\u201d.  \n  \u201cWhich means not just that your fridge goes off at home, but that the cold rooms go off at the supermarket, that we don\u2019t have reliable energy for the manufacturing process so jobs are lost in the Australian economy.\u201d \n  It went on like that for a while, before a journalist interjected to re-emphasise the actual question: \u201cBut what regions would this work in?\u201d \n  The opposition leader would only repeat previous pledges around building them on former coal power station sites, without narrowing down that list. \n  He said: \n   \n   We\u2019ve been very definite in our advice that we\u2019re looking at about half a dozen sites, on brownfield sites, those where you\u2019ve got a coal fired generator coming to an end of life. We\u2019ll make more announcements about that in due course. \n   Australia is the only country of the G20 that hasn\u2019t got nuclear as part of its energy mix, or hasn\u2019t committed to doing so as part of their domestic energy mix.

Israel will thoroughly investigate this tragedy to guarantee the safety and security of aid workers in Gaza. \n   \n  The comments come after the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he used a phone call with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to express anger and outrage at the killings. \n  Three cars were struck by Israeli drones on Monday night when they travelled along a route south of Deir al-Balah pre-approved and coordinated with the Israel Defense Forces. \n  The IDF chief of the general staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said the strike was \u201ca grave mistake\u201d that \u201cfollowed a misidentification at night, during a war, in very complex conditions\u201d. \n  But WCK said it was \u201can attack on humanitarian organizations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of war\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 3.58am BST \n \n \n  3.36am BST  \n  \n  Rosie Batty agrees money could be better spent stopping violence than buying submarines  \n  An audience member at Rosie Batty\u2019s National Press Club address has yelled \u201cdon\u2019t spend it on submarines!\u201d after Batty was asked what the government needs to do in the upcoming budget to \u201cput their money where their mouth is\u201d and help end violence against women and children. \n  \u201cVery good answer,\u201d Batty responded to the suggestion from the audience member. \n  Batty said the current model of funding distribution leaves the sector \u201cscratching around\u201d: \n   \n   The way that our funding is distributed, it does not encourage collaboration. It does not really encourage us all working together. We\u2019re kind of competing with each other, scratching around, trying to gather stuff. \n   The scale of this issue is so enormous. So we really do need to not let them off the hook, keep them accountable. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.46am BST \n \n \n  3.26am BST  \n  \n  Circling back to Rosie Batty\u2019s speech at the National Press Club. \n  Batty has urged a look at how unconscious bias impacts responses to domestic violence, saying one of the reasons her story was deemed so \u201chorrific\u201d was because she was a \u201cwhite privileged middle-class woman\u201d.  \n  She said: \n   \n   I will never know what it\u2019s like to have my visa hanging over my head or not have any rights and no benefits and no support, except some charitable model that may just help me, and the degree of isolation and abuse those women are experiencing defies belief.  \n   Aboriginal women disproportionately experience violence and the culture of violence is not Aboriginal. We know that. The effects of colonisation and racism, all of this - those [are] drivers. So I think it\u2019s our job still to not let those people who are experiencing violence be swept aside, to not be seen, to have no voice. We need to make space for them. \n   \n  Earlier in Batty\u2019s speech, she said a dedicated minister focussed on children would be an \u201cimportant step\u201d in ending violence against women and children. \n  She also backed the government\u2019s ambition to end the violence against women and children in a generation, saying: \n   \n   By making that bold suggestion, we can pressure the government towards that. How can we aim for less?

Is that the kind of accountability you want to see? \n  Albanese: \n   \n   Well, we have expressed very clearly that we need a full and proper explanation for how this has occurred. The first step is the acceptance of responsibility and that has occurred. But we want a very fast, immediate, clear and transparent process to occur. \n   \n  Q: Prime minister, how was your message received when you laid out Australia\u2019s position on the two-state solution on sustainable ceasefire, was there a sense of acquiesce? Do you feel like your message was being heard? \n  Albanese: \n   \n   We put our message which we have clearly not for the first time. As we have through the way that we have voted in the United Nations, as we have through the statements that we have issued. But we had a reasonably long conversation this morning. Prime minister Netanyahu expressed his views and I expressed the views of Australia. \n   \n  Q: Prime Minister, you\u2019ve noted the many civilian deaths in Gaza, you note the death of many aid workers, do you believe that Israel is at risk of losing the power of moral persuasion? \n  Albanese: \n   \n   I think that the global community is very concerned about the death toll that has occurred in Gaza. This latest incident will add to that concern which is there. We saw an extraordinary resolution of the UN Security Council just last week with the United States not vetoing that proposal. That gives a clear indication of global opinion, not just of leaders as well, but I think people when they look at what is happening in Gaza are very clear about the extraordinary loss of life which is there and I believe that Australians are very concerned about that. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.22pm BST \n \n \n  10.56pm BST  \n  \n  Albanese is asked what Australia will do if Netanyahu doesn\u2019t \u2018change course\u2019 \n  Albanese is asked if he had flagged with Netanyahu what actions Australia will take if the Israel government does \u201cnot change course\u201d or undertake a \u201csatisfactory investigation\u201d into Frankcom\u2019s death. Albanese did not indicate he had. \n  Albanese responded: \n   \n   I indicated and confirmed what Australia\u2019s position has been over a considerable period of time. I indicated my concern with a ground invasion of Rafah and the consequences for the civilian population there. I reiterated Australia\u2019s concern at the loss of life that has occurred in Gaza. I reiterated Australia\u2019s condemnation unequivocally of the events of October 7 and of Hamas as a terrorist organisation. I indicated very clearly Australia\u2019s view, as I have in every conversation I have had with prime minister Netanyahu, our support for a two-state solution in the Middle East, support for Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security with prosperity side by side, and that that was in the interests of both Israelis and Palestinians. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.24pm BST \n \n \n  10.51pm BST  \n Albanese speaks with Netanyahu: 'I expressed Australia's anger' \n  \n  Albanese has said he spoke with Israel\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning, expressing his concern over Australian aid worker Zomi Frankcom\u2019s death following an Israeli air strike. \n  Albanese said: \n   \n   I spoke with prime minister Netanyahu this morning with a phone call that was organised overnight. I expressed Australia\u2019s anger and concern at the death of Zomi Frankcom. \n   This is someone who was volunteering overseas to provide aid through this charity. This is completely unacceptable. The Israeli government has accepted responsibility for this and prime minister Netanyahu conveyed his condolences to the family of Zomi Frankcom and to Australia as a result of this tragedy. \n   \n  Albanese said Netanyahu has \u201ccommitted to full transparency about how this tragedy could possibly have occurred\u201d: \n   \n   When I spoke with the prime minister, I emphasised the importance of full accountability and transparency, and prime minister Netanyahu has committed to full transparency about how this tragedy could possibly have occurred. There is a need for a thorough investigation into what happened here and prime minister Netanyahu committed to that. \n   I made clear, again, that it is Australia\u2019s view that humanitarian assistance must reach people in Gaza unimpeded and in large quantities. \n   I conveyed to prime minister Netanyahu in very clear terms that Australians were outraged by this death, by this tragedy, of this fine Australian, and I indicated to prime minister Netanyahu as well just some of the characteristics that I spoke with Zomi\u2019s brother about yesterday. This is an Australian who we can all be proud of, someone who not only was in Gaza assisting people in need, but had in the past provided support for people in Bangladesh, in Pakistan, here in Australia after the bushfires. This was someone who was clearly committed to benefit her fellow humanity, and someone whose loss is very deeply felt by her family, but I think felt by Australians as well. \n   \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.30am BST \n \n \n  10.46pm BST  \n Sam Mostyn on becoming governor general: 'I'm deeply honoured by this great privilege' \n  \n  The incoming governor general, Samantha Mostyn, has said she is \u201cdeeply honoured by this great privilege\u201d. \n  Speaking now after Albanese\u2019s announcement about Mostyn\u2019s appointment, she said: \n   \n   I\u2019m deeply honoured by this great privilege and look forward to representing the values, hopes, and aspirations of all Australians.

And we will keep calling out these atrocities. And we will keep calling on our government, whichever political party it might be, to be better. And to call out this genocide and to stop the tacit and indirect support and to actively be so much stronger in our rhetoric. \n   \n  Asked if Waters accepts that \u201cAustralia is not sending weapons to Israel\u201d, she said: \n   \n   I\u2019m informed that the definition of weapons under relevant international conventions includes weapons components, we are sending weapons components and international law would say that\u2019s weapons. So I think we\u2019re getting into semantics when the principle of the matter is, Australia should not be supporting this genocide in any way and we should be strongly condemning it. And our government has been far too mild in its response. And they need to be calling for a permanent and lasting ceasefire that there\u2019s been too much death and murder. This is this is now a genocide and it\u2019s a manufactured famine. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.34pm BST \n \n \n  10.18pm BST  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese has called a snap press conference in Canberra at 8.30am.

As you said more than 30,000 civilians have been killed more, than half a million Palestinians are starving. What we have said to the Netanyahu government directly is that they must change course.

[2024-04-10T06:49:20Z]": "The Australian foreign minister, Penny Wong, has said a \u201cpathway out of the endless cycle of violence\u201d in the Middle East can only come with recognition of \u201ca Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel\u201d. \nSome commentators have interpreted the speech as a hint that Australia could recognise Palestinian statehood in the near term, although Wong has clarified that the government has made no such decision. \nSo what did Wong actually say about a two-state solution, what was she silent about, and how does this fit in with what Australia\u2019s allies are doing? \nWhat did Wong say? \n \n  Related: Palestinian state recognition the only hope to end violence in Middle East, Penny Wong says  \n \nIn a speech to the Australian National University national security conference on Tuesday, Wong made Australia\u2019s immediate priorities clear: \u201cour demand on all parties for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, enabling the release of hostages, the protection of civilians, and safe and unimpeded humanitarian access\u201d. \nBut Wong also called for work to build \u201cthe pathway to a peace that is enduring and just, because the simple truth is that a secure and prosperous future for both Israelis and Palestinians will only come with a two-state solution\u201d. \nWong said the Netanyahu government\u2019s \u201crefusal to even engage on the question of a Palestinian state\u201d had caused \u201cwidespread frustration\u201d, and that was why the international community was \u201cnow considering the question of Palestinian statehood as a way of building momentum towards a two-state solution\u201d. \nWong said the Australian government would call on \u201call parties to return to the table\u201d and support efforts to advance a political process. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nWhat caveats did Wong set out? \nWong was emphatic that the Australian government saw \u201cno role for Hamas in a future Palestinian state\u201d. \nWong also called for \u201ca reformed Palestinian Authority\u201d \u2013 the unpopular Fatah-dominated body that now has limited self-rule over parts of the Israeli occupied West Bank. \nWhat was Wong silent on? \nWong did not give any hint of when Australia might be prepared to recognise a Palestinian state, and she certainly did not say Australia would do it alone. Australian governments have traditionally seen this as a final step of a negotiated outcome between the Israelis and Palestinians; she was silent on whether that was no longer the case. \nOn ABC Radio National on Wednesday morning, Sally Sara asked whether Australia was \u201cready and willing to recognise Palestine as a state\u201d. Wong replied: \u201cLook, we\u2019ve made no such decision.\u201d Wong said her speech was grounded in the view \u201cthat we can be a friend to Israel and friend to the Palestinians\u201d. \nDoes this place Australia at odds with its allies? \nNo. The British foreign secretary, David Cameron, said in February that UK recognition of an independent state of Palestine, including in the United Nations, \u201ccan\u2019t come at the start of the process, but it doesn\u2019t have to be the very end of the process\u201d. He reiterated that it was important to \u201cgive the Palestinian people a horizon towards a better future.\u201d \nIn late January, Axios reported that the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had asked his department to present policy options on possible US and international recognition of a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza. \nThe report said options could include the US bilaterally recognising the state of Palestine or not using its veto to block the UN security council from admitting Palestine as a full UN member state. It is important to stress no formal decisions had been made to take these steps, only that they were under contemplation. \nSpain, however, has said it will recognise the state of Palestine before July. The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said in January that the world might need to \u201cimpose a solution\u201d and that Israel \u201ccannot have the veto right to the self-determination of the Palestinian people\u201d. \nWhat has been the political reaction in Australia? \nThe Coalition\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, said any \u201cfast-tracked\u201d recognition of Palestinian statehood was \u201cdangerous\u201d because it sent a \u201csignal to terrorists that you can get outcomes from the type of horrific actions that were undertaken on 7 October\u201d. \nBut the leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, said the government \u201cshould immediately recognise Palestine\u201d as there was \u201cno barrier to this happening right now\u201d. \nHow have Palestinian groups responded? \nThe president of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network, Nasser Mashni, said he welcomed Wong\u2019s support for the recognition of Palestine, \u201cbut it\u2019s only the beginning of the work Australia needs to do to contribute to the breaking of this 76-year history of Israeli violence against, and oppression of, Palestinians\u201d. \n \n  Related: \u2018Deadly failure\u2019: Australia demands Israel take \u2018appropriate action\u2019 against those responsible for killing aid workers  \n \nHow have Jewish groups responded? \nThe Zionist Federation of Australia\u2019s president, Jeremy Leibler, said talk of recognition \u201cin such close proximity to the 7 October attacks is entirely premature and will be seen as a reward for those attacks\u201d. \nThe president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Daniel Aghion, said Wong\u2019s speech was \u201cnot the way to treat a friend and ally of Australia\u201d and that the 7 October attack vindicated the Netanyahu government\u2019s belief that Palestinians were not \u201cserious about living in peace and coexistence\u201d. \nHowever, the Jewish Council of Australia \u2013 a relatively new group  that seeks to give expression to the views of Jewish Australians who do not give unquestioning support to the policies of the Israeli government \u2013 said the speech was \u201ca good step but actions speak louder than words\u201d. \nSarah Schwartz, the council\u2019s executive officer, said Australia \u201cmust do everything in its power to prevent Israel committing genocide\u201d and that \u201cany solution must ensure equality, freedom, justice and human rights for Palestinians and Israelis\u201d. \nThe executive director of the New Israel Fund Australia, Michael Chaitow, said Wong\u2019s speech set out \u201ca commonsense framework for advancing the prospects for peace\u201d. \n\u201cRecognition of a Palestinian state, undertaken alongside normalisation agreements between Israel and regional neighbours, including Saudi Arabia, must form the basis for a diplomatic solution to this ongoing conflict,\u201d he said.", "Morning Mail: PM reveals green industry strategy; Biden \u2018considering\u2019 dropping Assange charges; Queensland conspiracy theories [2024-04-10T20:51:13Z]": "Good morning.

Medical officials said the group had been helping to deliver food and other supplies to northern Gaza that had arrived hours earlier by ship. \n\u201cThis is an attack on humanitarian organisations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of war. This is unforgivable,\u201d World Central Kitchen chief executive officer Erin Gore said. \nAustralia\u2019s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has described Frankcom\u2019s death, alongside those of her colleagues, as \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d, saying they were undertaking \u201cextraordinarily important work\u201d and should have been protected. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \n\u201cThose doing humanitarian work and civilians need to be provided with protection.

Dfat have also requested a call-in from the Israeli ambassador as well. We want full accountability for this. This is a tragedy that should never have occurred.\u201d \nIn a television interview on the ABC on Tuesday night, Albanese said the Australian government had so far been unable to speak with the Israeli ambassador or other top officials. \n\u201cThere have been calls put in by the foreign minister (Penny Wong) to her counterpart and I have put in a request to prime minister Netanyahu to speak with him directly,\u201d Albanese said. \nThe Australian foreign minister, Penny Wong, said: \u201cThe tributes flowing for Lalzawmi \u2018Zomi\u2019 Frankcom tell the story of a life dedicated to the service of others, including her fellow Australians during natural disasters. \n\u201cHer tireless work to improve the lives of others should never have cost Ms Frankcom her own.

The letter read: \n   \n   The commission\u2019s general policy is to neither confirm nor deny the referral or investigation of corruption allegations unless the circumstances are exceptional. Here, the issues are especially important, their subject matter has already been widely publicised and the need for the integrity commission to assess and, if necessary, investigate them is apparent. \n   \n  Once assessed, the integrity body will then determine whether a full investigation should be launched. \n  The assessment will also look at Sofronoff\u2019s release of the final report to some media before it was handed to the ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, as well as other disclosures made by Sofronoff to the media during the inquiry\u2019s seven months. \n  Sofronoff had 273 interactions with Janet Albrechtsen, columnist for the Australian newspaper, during the inquiry into the handling of the Lehrmann trial. \n  Those interactions included 51 phone calls, text messages, emails and a private lunch meeting in Brisbane. Call logs submitted to court showed the former judge spent seven-and-a-half hours on the phone with the Australian over the seven-month period with most of that time to Albrechtsen. \n  A supreme court judge ruled last month those communications gave rise to an impression of bias against the former ACT director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, who Sofronoff had delivered damning findings about in his final report in July 2023. \n  In Sofronoff\u2019s defence against the claims, his lawyers said he discussed practical matters about the inquiry with Albrechtsen, including when documents would become available. \n  The ACT integrity commission gave no timeline for the length of the assessment process and said it would offer no further public comment until it has been completed. \n  \n Updated at 5.11am BST \n \n \n  5.01am BST  \n  \n  Good afternoon, everyone.

He was fined $1,000 plus $2,000 for the Brisbane city council\u2019s costs and just under $114 for court costs by magistrate Michael Holohan in October. \n  Pavlou set up a table and placards near the entrance to the Queen Street Mall and Chinese consulate in Brisbane\u2019s city centre in May 2022 and displayed signs saying \u201cNothing happened on June 4, 1989, change my mind,\u201d referring to the date when China\u2019s military violently ended a protest, and its government\u2019s efforts to censor discussion of the massacre. \n  Pavlou was issued an infringement notice after failing to comply with a Brisbane city council officer\u2019s instructions to \u201cpack up\u201d the placards as they constituted unauthorised advertising in the mall. \n  The university student had been communicating his view of the Chinese Communist Party via his freedom of expression under Queensland\u2019s Human Rights Act, Pavlou\u2019s lawyer Anthony Morris KC argued. \n  No conviction was recorded after the court heard it would affect Pavlou\u2019s plans to become a lawyer. \n  Pavlou said he was appealing against the fine as it was unfair that holding a blank sign on Brisbane city council land was subject to a \u201cmassive fine\u201d. He told AAP outside court: \n   \n   I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ll win \u2026 [and] it\u2019ll be a great victory for free speech. The Queensland Human Rights Act which makes very strong protections for freedom of speech, we think that that should protect the act of holding a blank sign. \n   \n  Pavlou\u2019s appeal against the fine due to be heard today was adjourned until 17 May as material had not been filed. \n  \n Updated at 4.40am BST \n \n \n  4.15am BST  \n Train and bus delays in Sydney as extreme weather continues along east coast \n  \n  Transport for NSW says its rail network is experiencing \u201cwidespread delays\u201d as extreme weather continues to hit the east coast. \n  A spokesperson said delays are affecting the following lines at various locations: T1 North Shore &amp; Western, T2 Inner West &amp; Leppington and T3 Bankstown, T8 Airport &amp; South and T9 Northern. \n  As of 1pm teams were also on site at Redfern station where a signal infrastructure issue was being fixed. \n   \n   Sydney Trains is out working in extreme conditions to rectify weather issues as they arise.

The union said firefighters entered the building rather than waiting for a back-up truck. One man was rescued and the building fire was controlled, but the union said firefighters are \u201cfurious\u201d. \n  Secretary Peter Marshall said it was \u201cappalling\u201d that firefighters were being forced to risk their lives simply because the state government refuses to invest to replace old, failed trucks and equipment: \n   \n   The union has previously said this fire season will be a late and severe one with almost 50 homes lost this fire season. Fire Rescue Victoria has for over two years raised the need for replacement appliances, but the minister has ignored the problem. \n   \n  The union said it has previously identified 60 fire trucks in metropolitan Melbourne that are more than 15 years old and have cracked doors, old engines, and rusted roofs. \n  \n Updated at 3.51am BST \n \n \n  3.18am BST  \n  \n  War of words between Victorian energy minister and federal counterpart \n  A war of words has erupted between Victoria\u2019s energy minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, and her federal counterpart, the resources minister Madeleine King, with the former accusing the latter of \u201csounding like a Coalition minister\u201d when it comes to the issue of gas supply. \n  D\u2019Ambrosio took to X/Twitter to hit back at comments King made on ABC Radio this morning about Queensland \u201cdoing the heavy lifting in terms of gas supply for the whole of the east coast\u201d. King had said: \n   \n   I\u2019m not interested in criticising decisions of state governments. They make their choices. What I would say is that Queensland is doing the heavy lifting. But any gas you transport from long distances, like from far north Queensland in Gladstone, all the way down to Melbourne or the industrial estates of Victoria, it costs more money to get hold of that gas because you\u2019ve got to move it through a pipeline. Or if the import terminals end up eventuating, you\u2019ve got to freeze the gas and defrost the gas and transport the gas \n   \n  King said she expected those costs to be passed on to consumers, and said her government had made reforms to shore up gas supply. \n  D\u2019Ambrosio wasn\u2019t having it. She wrote on X: \n   \n   So [King] is more like a Coalition Minister on radio this morning. How about talking the facts: 1.

Strong wind warning for Coffs coast and Batemans coast. \n   Severe weather warning for the east coast, stretching from just above Merimbula to just below Newcastle, and inland to Putty, Bathurst, Crookwell and the ACT. \n   Hazardous surf warning for the Macquarie coast, Hunter coast, Sydney coast and Illawarra coast \n   Warning to sheep graziers statewide for cold temperatures, rain and showers. \n   Minor to major flooding possible in the Hawkesbury-Nepean river from late Friday. \n   Minor flooding possible at Lismore. \n   Minor flooding possible at Yarraman Bridge in the Gwydir River catchment into Friday. \n   Minor flooding occurring at Willara Crossing in Paroo River catchment. \n   Minor flooding possible at Coraki and Bungawalbyn in Richmond River catchment into Friday. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.33pm BST \n \n \n  11.11pm BST  \n  \n  Nuclear energy \u2018would make power more expensive in Australia\u2019, SA premier says \n  The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, has argued that nuclear energy would make power more expensive in Australia rather than cheaper. \n  He spoke to ABC News Breakfast earlier and was asked to give his thoughts on nuclear being part of the country\u2019s future energy mix. \n  Malinauskas argued the debate about nuclear energy had been \u201cutterly captured by ideology\u201d on both sides and that in the past there had been \u201ctoo many decisions driven by unpragmatic ideology\u201d. \n  He said nuclear power would contribute to the \u201cdecarbonisation of the energy mix globally\u201d and argued the technology had evolved beyond safety concerns, but the main question remans: is it affordable? \n   \n   Every single objective, independent analysis that has looked at this has said nuclear power would make power more expensive in Australia rather than cheaper. Why we would impose that burden on power consumers in our country is completely beyond me. \n   One day in one hundred years time, nuclear technology might evolve and that could change. In South Australia, over 75% of all our energy comes from renewables now. When the sun is shining on a day like today, the price of power collapses and nuclear simply wouldn\u2019t be able to compete, which would result in an additional cost when the tens of billions of capital investment would have to be paid down. We have to stick to pragmatic solutions, and for us that is renewables and with gas-fired generation firming it. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.14pm BST \n \n \n  10.57pm BST  \n School closures across NSW amid severe weather \n  \n  Ten schools across New South Wales are non-operational amid the severe weather. \n  According to the Department of Education, eight public schools are closed today: \n  There are currently 8 NSW public schools non-operational. \n   \n   Baryulgil public school \n   Coffee Camp public school \n   Corndale public school \n   Longneck Lagoon environmental education centre, Maraylya \n   Megalong public school \n   North Star public school \n   Orama public school, Thora \n   Tulloona public school \n   \n  Meanwhile, two independent schools are also non-operational: \n   \n   Al-Faisal college, Auburn \n   Bhaktivedanta Swami Gurukula school, Eungella \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.06pm BST \n \n \n  10.54pm BST  \n Stay indoors alert issued for Sydney, Wollongong \n  \n  The NSW SES has just published a warning for people in Sydney, Wollongong, Nowra, Batemans Bay and Goulburn to stay indoors. \n  This is due to damaging winds and heavy to intense rainfall, it said. \n   \n   \n    EASTERN NSW Severe Weather \u2013 STAY INDOORS!The NSW SES is advising people in the following areas to STAY INDOORS due to damaging winds, and heavy to intense rainfall: #Sydney, #Wollongong, #Nowra, #BatemansBay, #Goulburn. pic.twitter.com/Rzn00PHghk\u2014 NSW SES (@NSWSES) April 4, 2024\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.02pm BST \n \n \n  10.52pm BST  \n  \n  SES conducted seven flood rescues overnight \n  Chief superintendent of the NSW State Emergency Service, Dallas Burnes, said the service had responded to more than 550 incidents across the state during the past 24 hours. \n  Speaking to ABC News Breakfast earlier this morning, Burnes said it had responded to 165 incidents in Sydney alone, and 552 statewide. \n  Around 800 volunteers have been active during the past 24 hours, he said. \n   \n   We\u2019re obviously very concerned with the rainfall to date and what\u2019s forecast for the next day. We\u2019re expecting to see flash flooding and riverine rises, and we\u2019re keeping a very close eye on where those falls are landing to make sure that we\u2019ve got teams ready to respond as needed. \n   \n  The SES conducted seven flood rescues overnight, six related to people in vehicles. Burnes reiterated a call for people to avoid non-essential travel. \n  The majority of calls have related to leaking roofs, as well as leaking sky lights, gutters overflowing, and localised light flooding, he said. \n  \n Updated at 10.58pm BST \n \n \n  10.46pm BST  \n  \n  New South Wales motorists told to avoid non-essential travel, take care on roads \n  Circling back to that earlier point from emergency services to avoid non-essential travel: \n  In a statement earlier this morning, Transport for NSW urged motorists across the state to take care on the roads and to avoid non-essential travel amid severe weather in the coming days. \n   \n   Parts of NSW could be hit by up to 300mm of heavy rainfall in the next 48 hours, with the worst of the weather expected to arrive overnight Friday into early Saturday morning. \n   \n  Those travelling to or from the Illawarra and Hunter, Nepean and Blue Mountains were warned to expect severe weather impacts. \n  Motorists who need to travel were warned to take their time and plan ahead by checking Live Traffic to see if their route is impacted by severe weather. Executive director of customer journey management, Craig Moran, said: \n   \n   Drive to conditions, turn your headlights on and allow plenty of distance between you and the car in front. Do not drive through flooded roads. If weather conditions become too severe, find a safe place to stop and wait until it passes. \n   \n  The warning extended to those taking public transport, who were urged to plan ahead, check timetables and allow extra travel time. \n  \n Updated at 10.53pm BST \n \n \n  10.39pm BST  \n  \n  Flood warnings for river systems in northern NSW \n  The Bureau of Meteorology was next to provide an update. A spokesperson said the weather system is currently impacting eastern NSW and central parts of the NSW coast, but would move south-east and into the Tasman Sea during Sunday. \n  He said severe weather warnings are in place for heavy rain and intense falls from Newcastle down to the south coast. \n   \n   We will start to see more rain from now into Friday night and into Saturday. The intense rainfall \u2026 is the driver for likely flash flooding. The broader rain is for the effects on run flooding \u2026 \n   \n  He said that over the next 24\u201348 hours there will be severe weather and a \u201cflow-on effect\u201d into catchments in the south of Newcastle down to the south coast. \n  Sydney received more than 100mm overnight, and the Wollongong area captured 50-80mm in different locations. \n  The spokesperson pointed to the four current flood warnings: \n   \n   One of them relates to previous rain in the north-west of the state. The other three relate to the current weather situation and they are the Wilsons River [where] there was a peak just below minor [flooding] overnight \u2026 The Richmond River nearby seems to have peaked overnight just below minor. We are keeping an eye on the Gwydir River today. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.44pm BST \n \n \n  10.32pm BST  \n  \n  Winds up to 90km/h expected across Sydney, SES says \n  The NSW SES commissioner, Carlene York, is next to address the media on the wet weather event in New South Wales. \n  She said SES resources are pre-positioned across the state to help those affected by rain, storms and potential flooding. The SES is expecting winds of up to 90km/h across the metropolitan area, she said. \n  York reiterated a call from Transport for NSW to avoid non-essential travel and to take care on the roads: \n   \n   At the moment out there the roads are dangerous, heavy rain. I am asking people to driver to the conditions. If it is not a necessary trip, put it off to another day. \n   \n  The SES had 550 calls in the 24 hours to 6am, largely for fallen trees affecting different homes and areas. \n  \n Updated at 10.42pm BST \n \n \n  10.29pm BST  \n  \n  Seven rescues across NSW since Monday amid wet weather, premier says \n  The NSW premier, Chris Minns, is providing an update from the SES headquarters on the wet weather situation in Sydney and right across the state. \n  He said this is a \u201csignificant weather event\u201d and it is vital everyone listens to the latest warnings and updates. \n   \n   There has been seven rescues since Monday by the SES across New South Wales. That number is expected to increase in the coming days. \n   It is crucially important that people in New South Wales \u2026 don\u2019t take unnecessary risks, that they listen to broadcasts from the SES and they are aware of their surroundings \u2026 Hopefully this weather pattern will move through metro Sydney and through the NSW south coast in the next few days. \n   It is a volatile event and we need to make sure we have the latest information. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.41pm BST \n \n \n  10.17pm BST  \n  \n  Coalition for Conservation responds to Matt Kean\u2019s resignation \n  The Coalition for Conservation has provided us with a statement following Matt Kean\u2019s decision to resign. \n  Kean, a former NSW energy minister and the current state shadow health minister, said he was concerned about the direction of the Coalition and its pro-nuclear energy stance (you can read more on this earlier in the blog here). \n  The Coalition said it regret\u2019s Kean\u2019s decision to stand down as an ambassador, and that it \u201cfirmly disagrees\u201d with the notion the organisation is \u201cconservative-minded\u201d because of its advocacy for nuclear energy. The Coalition also said it operates \u201cindependently of any funding from nuclear suppliers or the nuclear industry\u201d. \n  The statement reads: \n   \n   Our commitment to environmental protection remains unwavering, and our exploration of nuclear energy stems from its potential to reduce land and biodiversity impact. It\u2019s worth noting that many environmental organisations and think tanks globally are embracing nuclear energy as a component of a balanced energy mix. We continue to support a balanced approach that will ensure equality and protect our communities. We make no apologies for our efforts seeking alternative approaches to minimise environmental impact, and will continue to support behind the metre solar, small grids, good renewable projects that are placed in the right sites avoiding farming and forest land destruction as well as nuclear as part of the transition. \n   \n   \n    Related: The Coalition wants nuclear power.

Since 9am yesterday morning, there has been 106mm of rain. \n   \n   We are expecting rainfall over Sydney to increase during today \u2026 I would suggest that if we got more than the April average, that wouldn\u2019t be too beyond too far beyond this stretch of imagination. \n   \n  The Bureau\u2019s key message is that it\u2019s going to be a very wet, difficult day \u2013 people should call emergency services if they need help and stay out of flood waters, Reid said. \n  She also encouraged people to stay across any warnings as they are published today.

But they are not under the control of the IDF \u2026 they are completely independent of the system. But they have full access to all of the information, the operational details, the operational plans, the laws, the rules of engagement for specific missions, intelligence, what we knew, what we didn\u2019t know and notes and so on.

Since the dawn of war civilians have been caught up in warfare. We have to be better than that, we have to do better and I think that is our message this morning \u2026 \n   We need to make sure that [humanitarian workers] are not in harm\u2019s way and this is a clear failure of what we are expecting. We spoke yesterday to the office of the liaison officer of the IDF as an officer who was working closely with the [World Central Kitchen]. And he was just devastated from this because he was part of that coordination process. And we need to, and as I said, the details the specifics of what went wrong will be made public within the next 24 hours here in Israel. \n   \n  Asked about how well IDF commanders on the ground are complying with the rules of engagement, Lerner said if there are any breaches \u201cthen they need to be dealt with by disciplinary command level capabilities and perhaps even criminal [charges] if there\u2019s been a very dire mistake.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 9.56pm BST \n \n \n  9.30pm BST  \n Advocacy for nuclear power 'against the public interest': Matt Kean \n  \n  The New South Wales shadow health minister, Matt Kean, has resigned from the Coalition for Conservation over its stance on nuclear energy. \n  Kean, who was formerly an energy minister under the Berejiklian government, published his resignation letter to X last night and said he had become \u201cincreasingly concerned with the direction of the Coalition\u201d. \n  Kean said he first joined as an \u201centhusiastic supporter\u201d but he is now concerned about a growing focus on nuclear power in the electricity system: \n   \n   While I recognise that one cannot rule out nuclear playing a constructive role in the Australian electricity system in the distant future, the reality is there is no feasible pathway to play any material role in helping Australia replace our coal fired power stations in line with the climate science. \n   \n  Kean argued large scale nuclear reactors \u201chave proven costly and slow to deliver\u201d and said Australia does not have \u201cthe industry base, skilled workforce, regulatory architecture or social licence\u201d for nuclear power stations to be rolled out \u201cat a pace consistent with averting the worst effects of climate change\u201d. \n   \n   For these reasons I not only regard advocacy for nuclear power as against the public interest on environmental, engineering and economic grounds, I also see it as an attempt to delay and defer responsible and decisive action on climate change in a way that seems to drive up power prices in NSW by delaying renewables. \n   \n  The Coalition for Conservation has been contact for comment. \n   \n   \n    I have had concerns about the direction of @CforConserv for some time, but in recent months it\u2019s become very clear the group\u2019s values are not conservative and it has little interest in conservation.

Many thanks to Martin for kicking things off. I\u2019m Emily Wind, and I\u2019ll be bringing your our rolling coverage today \u2013 from a very rainy Sydney! \n  If you see something that needs attention on the blog you can get in touch via X, @emilywindwrites, or send me an email: emily.wind@theguardian.com. \n  Let\u2019s get started. \n  \n \n \n  9.06pm BST  \n  \n  Let\u2019s bring you more details about the plan by Richard Marles to make \u201chard decisions\u201d to cut some defence projects. \n  Speaking at the Sydney Institute last night, Marles was asked whether he had the support of the defence bureaucracy to cut back on historically high \u201cover-programming\u201d of the defence budget. The defence minister replied: \n   \n   It does mean taking some programs and not going ahead with them. It means re-profiling some. It means delaying others, re-scoping them. But unless we do that, the numbers don\u2019t add up. \n   Doing that is something which I actually think builds morale, because people now know that what\u2019s going on is real. This is not make-believe money, or make-believe announcements, or hoopla \u2013 it\u2019s actually fair dinkum. \n   And whilst there are difficult decisions that you need to digest, at least there is a sense that what\u2019s happening is fair dinkum and real. \n   \n  Marles said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be happier with the response that we\u2019ve received from within Defence in respect of that\u201d but he said it made sense \u201cbecause it means that people are going to work each and every day with a sense of purpose about what they\u2019re doing\u201d. \n  Elsewhere in the speech, Marles confirmed defence spending was on track to reach 2.4% of GDP by 2033\u201334. \n  That goal is not in question but the particular projects funded are up in the air. \n  \n Updated at 9.08pm BST \n \n \n  8.53pm BST  \n Richard Marles signals budget likely to contain cuts to defence programs \n  \n  The defence minister, Richard Marles, has signalled that next month\u2019s budget is likely to contain cuts to some programs within his portfolio, even as defence spending increases overall. \n  In a speech to the Sydney Institute on Thursday night, Marles flagged plans for \u201ctough but necessary decisions to divest, delay, or re-scope\u201d some projects in order to accelerate other projects \u201cthat will have the greatest impact on our strategic objectives\u201d. \n  He said the former Coalition government had \u201cadopted the habit of making large defence announcements without the money to turn these announcements into reality\u201d. \n  Marles said Labor had \u201cinherited a defence budget that was at historically high levels of over-programming\u201d, meaning programs that were promised without enough money allocated. He said that in some years \u201cthat over-programming reached 30 to 40%\u201d: \n   \n   That means that for every $100 Defence had to spend it was planning to spend $140. Or, in other words, more than a quarter of what Defence had planned to buy or deliver, it had no money for. \n   \n  Marles said some level of over-programming made sense, similar to the principle of managing a queue to allow for unforeseen circumstances or delays. But he said more than 20% over-programming was \u201ccostly for industry and ultimately dishonest\u201d because not all projects could happen and \u201ceveryone is just waiting for the eventual train wreck\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 9.07pm BST \n \n \n  8.45pm BST  \n Government launches national energy strategy \n  \n  The Albanese government has this morning released its national energy performance strategy to drive a high-energy performance economy, help consumers take control of their energy use and save on bills. \n  The plan targets five main areas where Australians can improve energy performance and ensure consumers can use energy more efficiently: the economy; households; communities, businesses and industry; the energy system itself; and technology and innovation. \n  This means investing in home energy ratings tools, lifting minimum standards for new builds, social housing upgrades, grants for small business and local government, and $1bn for low-cost loans to households. \n  In a statement released this morning, ministers claim the strategy has highlighted that: \n   \n   Between 2011, under changes made by the last Labor government, to 2022, minimum standards and transparency on energy efficiency saved Australians $12-18bn in energy costs. \n   Flexible demand \u2013 including both large-scale demand and controllable EV charging and batteries \u2013 would generate up to $18bn in cost savings for consumers through lower capital and wholesale prices by 2040. \n   Around 20% of global emissions reduction by 2030 will be achieved by electrification. \n   \n  It is hoped that consumers can make savings by upgrading appliances, homes and buildings; maximising off-peak times to reduce energy costs; and harnessing renewable energy technologies like solar, batteries or electric vehicles. \n  Ministers say they will also collate and publish more data to better track energy performance across the economy, better integrate demand-side opportunities into system planning, and establish an advisory group to better coordinate collaboration across business and governments. \n  \n Updated at 8.57pm BST \n \n \n  8.35pm BST  \n Welcome \n  \n  Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019ll be taking you through a few of the top overnight and breaking news stories until my colleague takes over. \n  The pressure on Australia to take a stronger stand against Israel after the Gaza aid worker killings intensified overnight when the charity involved urged the governments of the staff who died to join its call for an independent inquiry. Anthony Albanese called out his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, yesterday, saying the latter\u2019s comments that \u201cthis happens in war\u201d were \u201cnot good enough\u201d to try to justify the deaths of Australian Zomi Frankcom and six other aid workers who were delivering food in Gaza on Monday. But the international food charity World Central Kitchen has called for an independent investigation into the Israeli strikes and called on the governments of Australia, Canada, the UK, Poland and the US to back the demand. There\u2019s also pressure on Joe Biden to act and he discussed the incident with Netanyahu overnight. \n  When thousands of Australians began receiving demands for back tax from the ATO last year, many assumed they were the only ones to receive the letter. But Guardian Australia went on to reveal the campaign \u2013 quickly dubbed \u201crobotax\u201d \u2013 was designed to capture up to 1.8 million taxpayers of one description or another, mainly individuals, and raise in excess of $15bn. Jonathan Barrett unravels how the scheme started, how people reacted and what politicians are doing in response. \n  US shipyards are running up to three years late in building new Virginia-class submarines, according to a report ordered by the US navy secretary, Carlos Del Toro, which was published this week. The findings will only add to existing concerns about the viability of the plan for Australia to buy at least three Virginia-class submarines to fill a \u201ccapability gap\u201d in the 2030s. It comes as the defence minister, Richard Marles, has signalled that next month\u2019s budget is likely to contain cuts to some programs within his portfolio, even as defence spending increases overall. \n  And the huge storm predicted for New South Wales is expected to arrive today and could threaten parts of Sydney and other regions with flooding. Drivers have been warned to avoid non-essential travel as an inland low and coastal trough join forces over the state.  \n  More coming up. \n  \n Updated at 8.55pm BST \n", "Ten lawyers tell court Lehrmann may have leaked confidential material to Spotlight program \u2013 as it happened [2024-04-02T07:37:30Z]": "  8.35am BST    What we learned: Tuesday, 2 April    With that, we will wrap up the blog for the evening.

Here were the major developments of the day:  Network Ten has won its bid to reopen its defence in the defamation trial launched by Bruce Lehrmann, delaying the verdict until next week. An Australian citizen is among seven aid workers killed in an alleged Israeli Defence Force (IDF) strike on Gaza. Zomi Frankcom was working for the World Central Kitchen charity when she was killed. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the death was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d, adding the government would call in the Israeli ambassador and demand \u201cfull accountability\u201d. The Northern Territory Police Association (NTPA) has received legal advice that the youth curfew in Alice Springs may be unlawful. The curfew was imposed last week by chief minister Eva Lawler following civil unrest in the town, with anyone aged under 18 banned from going into the CBD between 6pm and 6am. And the Bureau of Meteorology has released statistics confirming March was Australia\u2019s third wettest on record, with rainfall nearly double the norm. It comes as nearly a month of rain was dropped on Victoria in 24 hours. The state\u2019s emergency services fielded more than 500 requests for help as thunderstorms pummelled Melbourne\u2019s western suburbs and the centre and east of the state on Monday.

Izzat Salah Abdulhadi, ambassador of the embassy, has placed pressure on Australia to harden its response.  This is not the first time that Israel has targeted humanitarian relief personnel during its genocidal onslaught on Gaza. Since 7 October 2023, the United Nations has recorded an \u2018unprecedented number of violations against its staff and facilities that surpass any other conflict around the world\u2019, with at least 174 UN employees killed by Israeli airstrikes and bombardments in just five months.

Matthew Richardson SC, for Bruce Lehrmann, argued that the new evidence was \u201ctrivial\u201d and it was not worth reopening the case for. Richardson said the additional financial benefits received by Lehrmann from Seven was three weeks\u2019 rent amounting to $12,000 on top of the $104,000 which was already disclosed. If the case is to be reopened and former Spotlight producer Taylor Auerbach is to be a witness, his psychiatric condition needs to be assessed, Richardson told the court.  Multiple journalists, including I assume some at the back of the court, have described [Auerbach\u2019s] appearances in public in recent weeks as bizarre.  Richardson said re-opening the case would require significant time and may delay the judgement.       8.22am BST    Death of Zomi Frankcom a \u2018crime\u2019, Palestine Advocacy Network alleges    The Australia Palestine Advocacy Network (APAN) has released a statement following the alleged Israeli airstrike that killed Australian aid worker Zomi Frankcom in Gaza, maintaining her death is not just a tragedy \u2013 but a crime. APAN alleges the death is the latest in a series of attacks on humanitarian convoys, workers and civilians seeking aid, that must be unequivocally condemned by the Australian government. Its president, Nasser Mashni, said:  Even when an Australian humanitarian worker is murdered by Israel while trying to feed starving Palestinians, the best the Australian government can do is to label this a \u2018tragedy\u2019 and \u2018request a call-in\u2019 from the Israeli ambassador. This is not a tragedy, this is a crime, and governments like ours are continuing to offer Israel the impunity to commit these crimes every time they respond using weak language like this.  Mashni said the commonwealth must immediately \u201cunequivocally condemn Israel\u2019s behaviour, pull every diplomatic and economic lever at its disposal\u201d and stop issuing permits for the export of Australian-made components for weapons being used by the Israeli government.

Under cross-examination in the defamation trial last year, Lehrmann said he gave Seven an interview only, despite his exclusivity contract saying he was required to give the network all relevant documents. Justice Michael Lee asked Ten\u2019s barrister, Dr Matt Collins KC, why the fresh evidence is relevant to the judgement he is about to hand down on Thursday in the defamation he brought against Ten and Wilkinson. Collins said the evidence goes to Lehrmann\u2019s credit and to whether he abused the court process, which may affect the quantum of damages. Sue Chrysanthou SC, for Lisa Wilkinson, told Justice Lee that Lehrmann had not been entirely honest about the financial benefits that he received from Seven. The court heard that the fresh evidence raises questions whether Lehrmann may have given instructions to his legal team which were not truthful. Lehrmann is opposing the application to reopen the case to hear new evidence.

The NSW Council for Civil Liberties, Liberty Victoria and the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties said they were particularly troubled by objectives \u201capparently underpinning the legislation\u201d, including exclusion of entire nations from migration and further criminalisation of people seeking safety.  Implicit in the government\u2019s legislation are the repugnant ideas that it is legitimate to exclude, detain, and criminalise people based on where they were born and regardless of their fears of persecution, and to respond to judicial consideration regarding infringements of our Constitution made by the nation\u2019s highest judicial body, the high court of Australia, with ill-considered workaround legislation and avoidance of scrutiny. It is obvious that there is no true urgency to this legislation, and the attempt to pass it in a single day demonstrates that the government has failed to respect the integrity of the parliamentary process.

In an update, the Bureau said oceanic indicators were still meeting El Ni\u00f1o thresholds, while consistent with its \u201cdecaying\u201d by the end of April, to become neutral in May.  While four out of seven international models are predicting a La Ni\u00f1a by late winter, the forecasts of the ENSO state beyond May should be used with caution. Forecasts have historically had their lowest skill for forecasts issued in April, with skill increasing from May. The oceans have been the warmest on record globally since April 2023. The global pattern of warmth is affecting the typical historical global pattern of sea surface temperatures associated with ENSO variability. As the current global ocean conditions have not been observed before, inferences of how ENSO may develop in 2024 that are based on past events may not be reliable.

A committee inquiry in Sydney this afternoon heard some more details about the new facility, which Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto) officials said would deliver a more reliable supply of isotopes for cancer diagnoses and treatments. There have been planned and unplanned shutdowns in recent years for maintenance. A 12,700m2 building will be built across from the Opal research reactor to futureproof Ansto\u2019s facility. Ansto provides almost 80% of the isotopes used in Australia for about 10,000 procedures a week. Ansto said the facility was \u201capproaching the end of its useful life\u201d after initially being built as a laboratory in the 1950s and the old facility would remain open during the transition. The replacement will cost about $620m.

Australia must heed the additional provisional measures ordered by the ICJ and do everything in its power to prevent Israel committing the international crime of genocide by killing, mass starvation and disease, including imposing sanctions and cutting military ties.

Currently it is the federal government that has this responsibility. The proposal is just one that the government has presented to a select group of conservation and business stakeholders in a closed consultation process it has been running since late last year. The government opted to run the selective consultation process instead of publishing an exposure draft of the proposed new laws for public feedback. The Greens said the consultation process lacked transparency, with participants \u201cnot permitted to take laptops or phones into the secret sessions\u201d or to take copies of the draft legislation. The planned reforms represent the biggest potential change to national environmental laws in two decades.

The statement says:  The WCK team was traveling in a deconflicted zone in two armored cars branded with the WCK logo and a soft skin vehicle. Despite coordinating movements with the IDF, the convoy was hit as it was leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, where the team had unloaded more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza on the maritime route.  Its Ceo, Erin Gore, said the attack was \u201cunforgiveable\u201d.  This is not only an attack on WCK, this is an attack on humanitarian organizations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of war. This is unforgivable.

By the Israeli accounts reported in media, there seems to be little doubt it was Israeli Defence Force strike to what we know is the World Central Kitchen that was assisting people in northern Gaza with the permission of the Israeli Defence Force. The aid they had been bringing was coming vetted by the Israelis from Cyprus and travelling up through into northern Gaza. It seems to be part of a larger pattern unfortunately though, that humanitarian workers have been targeted \u2026 the Israeli Defence Force was aware they were operating in the area.

Purcell says it\u2019s right the prime minister has called for accountability over Australian aid worker Zomi Frankcom\u2019s death, while urging the commonwealth to go further.  The denial of food aid is what appears to be a deliberate tactic in the war by the Israeli Defence Force (IDF). Insufficient aid has been allowed in for many months now by the IDF with the result that people \u2026 are at the risk of starving to death \u2026 Australia is a government that upholds the rule of law internationally and what we\u2019re seeing is systemic undermining of the rule of law in the conflict in Gaza by the denial of humanitarian assistance getting through.

ACFID chief executive Marc Purcell said in a statement:  Humanitarian workers in conflict zones should be ensured safety by combatants to carry out life-saving responses. Time and time again during this conflict we have seen Israeli forces demonstrate disregard for the safety of humanitarian workers with tragic results, with at least 196 aid workers killed to date \u2026 We call on the Australian government to urge the Israeli government to cease attacks on aid convoys and to allow for the safe land passage of humanitarian assistance. Further, Australia should protest in the strongest possible terms the starvation of civilians. Starving civilians is a breach of the laws of war, international law and common decency.     Updated at 4.39am BST     4.23am BST    Government announces $5.22m funding for communities affected by Middle East crisis    The federal government has announced $5.22m in funding for 37 organisations to support communities affected by the Middle East crisis. In a statement from immigration minister Andrew Giles, he said the funding is part of a $25m commitment to support Palestinian, Arab and Muslim communities. The statement reads:  It will assist organisations and communities to respond to the impact of the conflict and protect Australians from threats of racism, hate speech, violence, polarisation and social exclusion.  The initiatives announced today include $3.22m for 35 organisations to launch new social cohesion projects, and $2m for two organisations to deliver community programs to support Australian Palestinian and Muslim youth.    Giles said:  The Albanese government recognises the distress many Australians are feeling with the ongoing Hamas-Israel conflict and we are committed to working in partnership with affected communities to provide crucial support. Our approach supports both short and long term impacts of the conflict- enabling funding to be distributed rapidly to communities most in need while also building capacity in affected communities. Our priority is to provide support to those that have been impacted, and to enhance and foster community connection during these challenging times.

The Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) welcomed the verdict for breaching the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act. Following a guilty plea, the Downing Centre local court convicted and fined Qualify Me! Pty Ltd for advertising 187 vocational education and training courses in 2022 without including details of the registered training organisation (RTO) that would issue a VET qualification or statement. ASQA CEO Saxon Rice said the prosecution should serve as a warning to dodgy providers. ASQA\u2019s VET tip-off line has received more than 1,000 tip-offs since launching last October:  These third-party organisations must accurately and honestly represent those courses in all marketing and enrolment activities \u2013 to ensure students\u2019 best interests are protected and they can make an informed choice.  Under amendments to the act, penalties for breaches have increased five-fold to deter providers that saw penalties as a cost of doing business.    Updated at 4.20am BST     4.07am BST       Health minister warns of \u2018vaccine fatigue\u2019 ahead of early flu season The Victorian health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, says the state is facing an early flu season and has urged people to get vaccinated. Speaking alongside the premier on Tuesday, she said:  We\u2019re expecting an early flu season and flu vaccines have just become available, so I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to encourage all Victorians to get their flu vax ... Anyone that\u2019s ever had the flu can tell you it\u2019s a very debilitating, dangerous disease. So it\u2019s important that we continue to send a strong message that our flu vaccines are safe and reliable and accessible.     She said there was evidence of \u201cvaccine fatigue across a range of vaccines\u201d, which is a concern:  I think it\u2019s important that [and] we continue to encourage our Victorians to access vaccines, particularly for seasonal illnesses like the flu because they are safe and effective. Unfortunately, we live in an age where there is a lot of misinformation available, and that sometimes gets in the way of people\u2019s best judgment. So talk to your general practitioner, talk to your pharmacist. If you have any concerns, they will talk you through the efficacy of the flu vaccine, and indeed other vaccines that continue to be available, including Covid vaccine.

During the ramped-up police operation, 5,709 speed infringements were issued, 295 people were charged with drink driving and 863 people tested positive to drug tests. Assistant commissioner Brett McFadden said the state couldn\u2019t accept the \u201cirresponsible behaviour\u201d of a minority.  It is time we as a collective worked together to end this carnage on our roads.  Among infringements were a Toyota Corolla detected travelling at 188km/h in a 110km/h zone on the Hume Highway near Bowning and a 15-year-old recorded doing 150km/h in a 50km/h zone in Orange. In Victoria, three lives were lost over the same period, including two separate motorbike accidents in Oakleigh South and Gordon. More than 8,000 traffic offences were detected across Victoria over the Easter long weekend, including almost 4,000 Victorians caught speeding and 378 impaired drivers taken off the roads for getting behind the wheel with alcohol and/or drugs in their system.    Updated at 4.03am BST     3.47am BST       Qantas plane to re-enter service after previous engine issue A regional Qantas plane is set to re-enter service on Wednesday after an engine issue forced pilots to turn around shortly after take off and land at Lord Howe Island. On Friday afternoon, the 27-year-old 36-seat Dash-8 Q200 turboprop plane experienced an issue with one of its engines as it took off from Lord Howe Island bound for Sydney. A Qantas spokesperson said:  The pilots followed standard procedure, shut down the engine and landed safely back at Lord Howe Island without incident. Engine shutdowns are rare but aircraft are designed to operate safely with one engine, and our pilots are highly trained to manage this ... We know this may have been unsettling for our customers on board and we thank them for their cooperation.     The plane made a priority landing back at Lord Howe Island, and passengers disembarked normally. Customers were provided with overnight accommodation and re-accommodated on flights over the weekend. The Dash-8 is expected to return to service on Wednesday. The incident followed another Qantas flight \u2013 a much larger Airbus A330 \u2013 from Melbourne to Perth last week, where an engine issue also forced pilots into shutting down of the engines mid-flight.    Updated at 4.12am BST     3.37am BST       Circling back to the national press club, where Greg Combet has been taking questions in relation to Australia\u2019s net zero transition. Earlier, Combet mentioned that significant capital will be required throughout this transition. Can he quantify this?  It\u2019s a very significant investment task and ideally institutional investment, private capital, would see the opportunities in it and make commercial judgements and invest and they are, if they can see that making sense. [But] I can see occasions and projects in this particular transformation where government is going to need to play a role and as I said earlier, that is not novel.  And in terms of how many workers will be part of this transition, moving into new renewable jobs, he responded:  We do know that certainly by mid 2030 is 10, 11, 12 coal-fired power stations will be closing. That\u2019s several thousand workers directly impacted by that, and on top of that you have workers who may be employed in what we call captured coalmine \u2013 which is their only customer is the power station.  And with that, Combet\u2019s latest appearance at the NPC has wrapped up.      Updated at 3.43am BST     3.20am BST       \u2018Very urgent inquiries\u2019 being made into death of Australian aid worker in Gaza: PM The prime minister Anthony Albanese says the Department of Foreign Affairs is making \u201cvery urgent inquiries\u201d about the death of an Australian aid worker in Gaza. He praised Zomi Frankcom as \u201cdoing extraordinarily valuable work\u201d. Albanese read out details of her other volunteer work, which he said included helping Australians during bushfire emergencies:  This is someone who was volunteering overseas to provide aid through this charity for people who are suffering tremendous deprivation in Gaza. And this is just completely unacceptable. Australia expects full accountability for the deaths of aid workers, which is completely unacceptable. Aid workers and those doing humanitarian work, indeed all innocent civilians, need to be provided with protection. This news today is tragic.  Albanese sent \u201csincere condolences\u201d to those who knew Frankcom:  The sort of values that are shown by someone going into a very dangerous place, in order to assist mankind, their fellow humans, people she didn\u2019t know. She just wanted to help out through this charity, it says everything about the character of this young woman.       Updated at 3.38am BST     3.18am BST       Meanwhile an Australian judge on the UN\u2019s international court of justice, Hilary Charlesworth, has called for Israel to suspend its military operations in Gaza. You can read the full story from Daniel Hurst below:   Related: Australian international court judge calls for Israel to suspend Gaza military operation         3.16am BST       Anthony Albanese went on to say he was \u201cconcerned about every innocent civilian\u201d killed in the Gaza conflict. He said civilian deaths were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. The PM says the government continues to call for a \u201cpolitical solution, that means a two-state solution\u201d to the Middle East conflict.       3.14am BST    Albanese demands \u2018full accountability\u2019 over death of Australian aid worker killed by Israel    The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says the death of an Australian aid worker in Gaza is \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and \u201cbeyond any reasonable circumstances\u201d, saying the government will call in the Israeli ambassador and contact Israel\u2019s government. Albanese says the government is demanding \u201cfull accountability\u201d over the death. Albanese named the aid worker as Zomi Frankcom, who was working with World Central Kitchen in Gaza. At a press conference in Brisbane, Albanese said Frankcom was doing \u201cextraordinarily important work\u201d. Four foreign nationals working for the food aid charity were killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza, according to health officials in the occupied territory. The founder of the charity, World Central Kitchen (WCK), confirmed on Twitter that \u201cseveral\u201d staff members had died in an Israeli airstrike.   Related: Four foreign aid workers and Palestinian translator killed in Israeli strike, Gaza officials say    Albanese said the circumstances were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and \u201cAustralia expects full accountability for the death of aid workers\u201d.  Those doing humanitarian work and civilians need to be provided with protection. Australia has had a very clear position of supporting a sustainable ceasefire ... Australians want to see an end to this conflict. This news today is tragic. Dfat have also requested a call-in from the Israeli ambassador as well. We want full accountability for this, this is a tragedy that should never have occurred.  The PM said the government had contacted the Israeli government directly. He said the incident was \u201cbeyond any reasonable circumstances\u201d.    Updated at 5.03am BST     3.12am BST       Greg Combet is now taking questions, and is asked about the transition away from coal to renewables. He said it would be a \u201ccollaborative effort\u201d between government and companies, and the transition has been \u201cdesigned to try and achieve that\u201d.  They have got closure dates in mind \u2026 but we have to think not just about them and their business, it is important to think about the workers who are involved, who work for those companies and the many other workers in these regions where the power stations are located.     Combet said through his work with the ACTU he has witnessed that restructures are \u201cnot always as smooth\u201d as hoped.  It is often pointed to, for example, that the closure of the Hazelwood power station in the La Trobe Valley in Victoria was very disruptive and that was on the back of the privatisation of the assets in the 1990s. And there are many scars there. The community has then deeply impacted for a very long period of time \u2026 and I think we have to do a lot better in navigating this period of change and seek the cooperation of the energy companies. It is not meant to be an adversarial set up, but if access to the Fair Work Commission \u2026 is needed because we cannot have a perfectly collaborative approach to a power station closure, then it is there is a backup.     Updated at 3.41am BST     3.03am BST       Combet: Net zero transformation \u2018may even define this century\u2019 Wrapping up his speech, Greg Combet said the most vital thing he has learned through his work is the importance of letting values guide change.  Respecting people and ensuring fair treatment, aiming at equitable outcomes, generating a commitment of common purpose, a sense that we are all in it together \u2013 we have endeavoured to embed these values in the new authority through the people we have employed, the policies we have developed, the legislation, the culture and our engagement with the community. I think that will be a key to achieving positive and orderly change. The treasurer has said that the net zero transformation will define the decade. It may even define this century. It should be a transformation built on the very best of Australian values and it should deliver significant benefit for future generations. And we can do it. Just as countless others have done before us at similar moments of historic change.     Updated at 3.05am BST     3.00am BST       A renewable transition for Gladstone in central Queensland is not the only example Greg Combet is referencing. He is outlining a number of upcoming or potential projects, including hydrogen energy in the Port of Newcastle, transitioning the Hunter\u2019s aluminium smelter Tomago to renewable energy, and in the Pilbara, plans with Bluescope steel to decarbonise iron production.  The net zero economy authority is putting together a pipeline of these projects and will be figuring out how to bring them to concrete investment decisions. Hundreds of billions of dollars in investment will be needed to achieve net zero. The fact is, neither government funding or private capital alone can meet that challenge. It will take both working together to secure the opportunities of Australia\u2019s net zero future. This means providing the policy context and direction that will encourage business to invest.     Updated at 3.06am BST     2.52am BST       Greg Combet on the transition from coal-fired power stations Continuing his speech at the National Press Club, Greg Combet argued that helping regional communities through the transition away from coal will be key to Australia\u2019s net zero transformation. He said Gladstone in central Queensland is just one region where new investment and job opportunities can be realised through this transition \u2013 a region producing more than 40% of Queensland\u2019s energy and home to almost half of Australia\u2019s coal mines.  All of this heavy industry means the region is also one of the most emissions-intensive places in the country, producing over a third of Queensland emissions. In my view, successfully transforming the region around Gladstone and similar regions around the country must be a key national endeavour and to do it we have to support the people, communities and region through that process \u2026  Combet said the Net Zero Economy Agency will work with companies and unions representing workers to help them transition to alternative jobs, and offer participation in a redeployment scheme.  Workers from the closing power station will then be connected with employment opportunities with another employer in the same or a similar industry. We will try to align people with jobs available in new clean industries.       Updated at 3.40am BST     2.46am BST       Greg Combet said the Net Zero Economy Agency is not seeking to take on the role of existing government agencies, but complement and coordinate policy development, identifying gaps and ensuring \u201ceverything is headed in the same direction\u201d. He said Australia is in \u201can early stage\u201d of its net zero transformation, with a decades-long journey ahead.  It is important to bear that in mind when you read about the current social license issues, planning problems or supply chain constraints. These are all substantial problems that need to be tackled, no doubt. The \u2026 nature of these challenges means that we need new ways of working across governments, in particular with our state [and] territory colleagues. We need to work in an integrated way thinking beyond our individual remits to recognise the interconnectedness of the problems at hand. But significant progress is being made and people are coming together. The energy transition is the catalyst.     Updated at 2.51am BST     2.43am BST       Through his role, Greg Combet said he has witnessed \u201coptimism\u201d about Australia\u2019s renewable future through the \u201cpractical action\u201d and \u201cdetermination\u201d of industrial regions, who are \u201creadying themselves\u201d for new opportunities. This is \u201ca different story\u201d to when he was climate minister and travelling around the regions around a decade ago, he said.  To me, the economic argument is simple: as our trading partners pursue their own emissions reduction target and wealth from our fossil fuel exports decline, we must create new sources of wealth from industries powered by renewable energy \u2013 and at the same time support people, workers, communities and regions through this change. There is absolutely no doubt about our collective capacity to do it, and do it well.     Updated at 2.44am BST     2.39am BST       Greg Combet addresses National Press Club about net zero pathway Former Labor minister and former secretary of the ACTU, Greg Combet, is addressing the National Press Club today about the net zero pathway. Combet is chair of the Net Zero Economy Agency, concluding on 31 May, after which he will begin as chair of Australia\u2019s Future Fund.  My instructions from the boss were clear: develop a plan that will help people and communities through change, respect their interests, create opportunities and leave no one behind.     Combet said the Net Zero Economy Agency will oversee the transformation from fossil fuels to an economy powered by renewable energy and clean industries. He said the debate surrounding climate science has \u201clargely settled\u201d and a \u201cglobal consensus has emerged\u201d calling for serious action to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  Lived experience is having a big influence on people [with] more frequent and devastating natural disasters [and] temperature records set and exceeded, with last year recording the highest average temperatures in 174 years of record-keeping. For Australia I have likened the scale and significance of the net zero transformation to post-war reconstruction, and that is because of our economy\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels.     Updated at 3.39am BST     2.32am BST       Jacinta Allan also paid condolences to the Victorian father and grandfather who died trying to save a two-year-old child who fell into a Gold Coast pool on Sunday. She said:   I pass on my deepest sympathies to the family who were there on a holiday. To have a holiday conclude in such a tragic and terrible set of circumstances must be devastating for those family members, particularly given they were going in [to the pool] to protect another family member. So this is a really, really tough time for that family and the broader community and my sympathy goes to them.   Asked if the government needed to do more to provide swimming lessons to adults and members of the state\u2019s multicultural communities, Allan replied:   We already have a range of different programs in place and I would certainly encourage everyone to be safe around the water. There will be investigations into what happened in this incident in Queensland, so I don\u2019t want to cut across and presume what may or may not have happened in this incident. Today, I think our focus should be on supporting the family and the loved ones who\u2019ve gone through such a terrible, terrible tragedy at a time when they were hoping to enjoy a really lovely holiday.         2.25am BST       Victorian government launches survey as part of inquiry into women\u2019s pain Jacinta Allan also announced the launch of a survey as part of the government\u2019s inquiry into women\u2019s pain.  She said the government was seeking the views of women and girls who have experiences with pain and accessing related services as well as clinicians and healthcare workers in the field.        2.24am BST       Victoria announces locations for five women\u2019s health clinics The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, held a press conference in Epping, in Melbourne\u2019s north, earlier today to announce the locations of the first five public comprehensive women\u2019s health clinics. At the 2022 election, Labor committed to opening 20 of the clinics to deliver specialist care for conditions including endometriosis, pelvic pain, polycystic ovary syndrome, perimenopause and menopause. Allan announced the first five will open at the Northern hospital, Royal women\u2019s hospital, Frankston hospital, Barwon Health Geelong and Ballarat base hospital from June. Both the Royal women\u2019s hospital and Barwon Health have existing women\u2019s health clinics, which \u2013 as a result of the government funding \u2013 will now extend their services to five days a week. The three other locations will be new clinics. Allan said:  These women\u2019s health clinics are being centres in our public health system, and will provide access to a range of services women need. They\u2019ll be able to access support from gynaecologists, urologists, specialist nursing care ... specialist physiotherapist care as well. These are trained professionals who are focused on women\u2019s bodies and women\u2019s health needs, and being able to have all of these services located in one place means it\u2019s easier for women to access the range of different health services they need.       Updated at 2.30am BST     2.18am BST       Melbourne recorded wettest day since 5 March 2020: Weatherzone Circling back to the Victorian weather, and the Bureau of Meteorology has cancelled a severe weather warning affecting parts of the state. It says the immediate threat of severe weather has passed, but the situation would be monitored and further warnings issued if needed. Weatherzone reported that during yesterday\u2019s downpour, Melbourne experienced one of its heaviest days of April rain in 47 years. This comes after the driest March in 170 years of records, it said. Weatherzone reported the following statistics:  Just 2.8 mm was recorded in Melbourne\u2019s gauge at Olympic Park during the whole of March 2024. In the 24 hours to 9am Tuesday, a total of 53.2 mm of rain was recorded. That made it the wettest Melbourne day in any month since 5 March 2020.     Updated at 2.24am BST     1.43am BST       Reserve Bank did not consider an interest rate rise at its March board meeting Underscoring the likelihood that the RBA is done with lifting interest rates, minutes out this morning from its March board meeting show that there was no consideration given to another rate hike. Governor Michele Bullock was a bit cagey about what the board had mulled during the 18-19 March meeting in the subsequent media briefing two weeks ago. With the release of the minutes of the meeting today, though, we see that unlike the previous handful or more of meetings, the board members did not weigh up whether to lift the cash rate or leave it where it sat (at 4.35% presently). Instead of two cases to consider, there was just an agreement that \u201cit was appropriate to leave the cash rate target unchanged at this meeting\u201d, the minutes show. Sure, there was a resolve to not \u201crule in or out future changes in the cash rate\u201d, but given the option of a 14th rate rise was not on the cards, it would take a surprise for that prospect to be back on the agenda you\u2019d have to think. It also suggests the next time members weigh up multiple options it will be whether to cut the interest rate or stay put. Perhaps we\u2019ll see that former case being made when the RBA board next meets on 6-7 May.    Updated at 1.59am BST     1.33am BST       Spotlight on hotel pool safety after men drown Safety measures in hotel pools should be examined following the tragic deaths of a man and his father while trying to save a toddler who fell into a pool, lifesaving authorities say. Dharmvir Singh, 38, and Gurjinder Singh, 65, leapt into the pool at a Gold Coast hotel to try to save the younger man\u2019s child on Sunday. The child had been playing on the step of the pool before losing their footing and falling into deeper water. When the father and grandfather tried to save the toddler, they got into trouble in the water themselves. Royal Life Saving chief executive Justin Scarr said it was tragic the two men died rescuing a young child.    Related: \u2018Extremely emotional scene\u2019: father and grandfather die after bid to rescue toddler in Gold Coast pool    Scarr said there have been a number of drownings in hotel or motel swimming pools over the past few years and there is a need to look more closely at the safety guidelines of these pools. He told AAP:  It may be that the current regime, signing and fencing is not enough and more needs to be done, given a range of factors including the sorts of activities that people are doing in those pools and perhaps some weaknesses in people\u2019s understanding of water safety.  Scarr said there had been at least 34 drowning deaths in March across the country. Over the 2023/2024 summer months, 99 people drowned.     - from AAP       1.18am BST    Alice Springs youth curfew \u2018unlawful\u2019, according to advice given to NT police union    The Northern Territory Police Association (NTPA) has received legal advice that the youth curfew in Alice Springs may be unlawful. The curfew was imposed last week by chief minister Eva Lawler following civil unrest in the town, with anyone aged under 18 banned from going into the CBD between 6pm and 6am. In a statement, NTPA president Nathan Finn says he sought advice on the legality of the curfew after it was announced, and on 29 March was provided with this response:  In my opinion the declaration is unlawful and police operating under that declaration are at risk of acting unlawfully.  The advice referenced section 4(2) of the Emergency Management Act 2013, which says:  This Act does not authorise a person to do, or make preparations to \u2026 put down a riot or other civil disturbance.     Upon receiving this advice, Finn raised concerns with NT police commissioner Michael Murphy. Finn argues the curfew is \u201cnothing more than a knee-jerk reaction and, once again, it is police who are lumped with cleaning up [the] government\u2019s mess following years of poor law and order policy decisions\u201d. Murphy has defended the curfew on ABC News Breakfast saying \u201cif there\u2019s a formal legal challenge, there\u2019s a process with the court system\u201d. He says there are three things the Act cannot be used for: \u201cthe suppression of civil disorder, armed combat, or ending a strike\u201d, adding \u201cwe\u2019re not using the Act for any of those\u201d.    Updated at 3.08am BST     12.59am BST       Mal Lanyon to lead NSW Reconstruction Authority The New South Wales Police deputy commissioner Mal Lanyon has been appointed to act as chief executive officer of the NSW Reconstruction Authority. According to a joint statement from state ministers Paul Scully and Jihad Dib, outgoing Simon Draper will cease his responsibilities to \u201csolely focus on leading the public service as secretary of Premier\u2019s department\u201d. Lanyon will commence his role as Acting CEO on 8 April. Draper commenced as secretary of the Premier\u2019s department on 1 September 2023, and has been doing both roles over the past seven months, the statement said.    Scully says he looks forward to working with Lanyon in the coming months. Janelle Saffin, parliamentary secretary for Disaster Recovery, says:  I worked alongside Mal following the devastating floods in the Northern Rivers and am thrilled to be working with him again. There is no better person to lead this organisation, to ensure our state is prepared for disasters, and to help NSW recover after they strike.  The Reconstruction Authority was established last December to reduce the impact of floods, fires and other major disasters, and to help communities from them faster.

Two week ago, the bureau said the current El Ni\u00f1o in the Pacific was \u201cnear its end\u201d and perhaps we\u2019ll see that end declared today. If not, its demise is probably not too far off, with the bureau main climate model pointing towards its steady decay:    Australia&#39;s @BOM_au will update its climate drivers report later today, and we might be close to the end of the El Nino.

There\u2019s less confidence in model forecasts for what sea-surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific will do than at other times of the year. That said, the US\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been forecasting a La Ni\u00f1a will quickly replace the El Ni\u00f1o for a while. It rates the odds of the switch happening by August at 62% in its latest update.    The US&#39;s @NOAA, though, notes how conditions in the equatorial eastern Pacific have tilted consistently towards another La Nino forming.

Katy Gallagher says a draft for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission has been leaked, but it would impose sanctions on politicians found to be in breach. She told ABC News Breakfast earlier:  That\u2019s the whole point of it. We\u2019ve established the parliamentary workplace support service that does handle complaints ... but this other body will be set up, and part of the whole purpose of this body is to look at complaints. And where complaints are substantiated, to implement sanctions against whoever that may be, whether it be an MP, senator or a staff member who works in this place (parliament).  Former sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins\u2019 2021 report called for the commission, which would have the power to impose penalties for serious breaches of workplace safety including sexual assault and bullying. The independent body is supposed to be up and running by October. Asked about the delay in establishing the commission, Gallagher says it hasn\u2019t been done before:  We\u2019re trying to get agreement across the parliament. We\u2019re working really well with the opposition and with the crossbench on this.     Updated at 11.55pm BST     11.26pm BST    Committee with three Labor senators criticises deportation bill    The Senate standing committee for the scrutiny of bills has criticised Labor\u2019s deportation bill. The bill, which the Coalition and Greens sent to a six-week inquiry to report in budget week, threatens unlawful non-citizens with a year in prison if they refuse to cooperate in measures to facilitate their deportation. The Senate committee, which has three Labor senators, Raff Ciccone, Tony Sheldon and Jess Walsh, criticised mandatory minimum sentences. It says:  While the committee acknowledges that the penalty and minimum sentence are intended to reflect the seriousness of the offence and act as deterrents, the committee reiterates its longstanding view that the use of mandatory minimum sentences impedes judicial discretion.  The immigration minister would be able to write regulations adding visa classes to the list that can receive orders. The committee took a dim view of this:  The committee is of the view that the ability to expand the scope of people that may be subject to removal pathway directions is a significant matter that would more appropriately be dealt with by way of primary rather than delegated legislation.     It also criticises powers for the immigration minister to reverse a protection finding:  [This is] clearly a significant and rights affecting matter and it is not clear to the committee why such a power is necessary as it has not been fully explained in the explanatory memorandum. It is also unclear to the committee whether any procedural fairness protections apply in relation to any decisions made by the minister to overturn an existing protection decision.  Finance minister Katy Gallagher has this morning responded to some of the criticism, which we covered in the blog here.

The prime minister will visit Rheinmetall\u2019s Vehicle Centre of Excellence in Ipswich today to spruik the deal, which will support 600 direct jobs in Queensland. Germany\u2019s parliament has approved a plan to buy the Boxer heavy weapon carrier vehicles. They will be built in Queensland by the German company\u2019s subsidiary, Rheinmetall Defence Australia. Albanese says manufacturing the vehicles boosted the nation\u2019s sovereign capability while strengthening the country\u2019s security partnership with a European power.

So, just a reminder to people to never drive through flood water. If the road is flooded, I encourage people to stop, turn around and find an alternate path.  Mason expects the number of SES callouts to rise in coming hours as the weather system heads east and more residents wake up to find damage to their homes.

As we reported earlier, almost 500 requests for help were made to emergency services as heavy rain, thunderstorms and winds lashed the state on Monday and overnight. Baker says that number has grown, with crews responding to over 510 requests for assistance around Melbourne and the outer metropolitan region, into South Gippsland and some of the closer western districts, and Geelong. Most of the jobs have been water through ceilings, Baker says, but there were four rescues from cars in water. He says it has been the wettest day in Melbourne since around 5 March, 2020:  Let\u2019s get \u2026 through today and just stay safe until we\u2019re through to clear skies, and hopefully settled weather later on in the week.     Updated at 11.11pm BST     10.55pm BST       Gallagher defends handling of deportation bill, says government following advice from agencies Moving to the deportation bill, Katy Gallagher is asked about criticism it was rushed through parliament. Independent senator David Pocock spoke about this a bit earlier. Gallagher says \u201cmost reports\u201d from the scrutiny of bills committee raises concerns about legislation, so it\u2019s \u201cnot that surprising\u201d to her.  The government\u2019s advice from our advisers around how to ensure that we\u2019ve got the most robust migration system was to pass this bill, to pass it last week. That didn\u2019t happen and we\u2019ll work with the Senate about getting it done as soon as possible \u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprise that the Scrutiny of Bills committee, which is a particular committee that looks at legislation and particularly about the technical drafting and where powers exist, has provided feedback on that bill. We\u2019ll work through that as well.     Asked what the rationale is for trying to rush it through parliament last week, she says:  It was the advice from agencies about making sure we had all the tools that we needed ready to go to keep our migration system as strong as it can be. And this was identified as a potential gap in legislation and that, once those gaps are identified, it is pretty important when you\u2019re dealing with the migration system to work to close them as soon as possible.  Gallagher says the government tried to work with the opposition to pass this but it \u201cchose to play politics and not to respond to the advice that we had from our agencies\u201d. Host Lisa Millar asks whether the government is trying to get ahead of a High Court case due in the middle of April. Gallagher:  Well, there\u2019s a number of cases that are always before the courts, Lisa, and it\u2019s not helpful for me to be in a position where I comment on them.  She again points to the advice from agencies regarding the bill.    Updated at 11.05pm BST     10.45pm BST       Government expects \u2018five to 10\u2019 regulated digital ID providers Katy Gallagher says private companies could \u201cpotentially\u201d access the expanded digital ID. Once fully operational, the government doesn\u2019t expect \u201chundreds of regulated digital ID providers\u201d, but about five to 10, with potentially more over time. Gallagher says the scheme would be voluntary and \u201cif you don\u2019t want it, don\u2019t have one\u201d.  We\u2019ve got 10.5 million people with a myGov ID in place already; you know, it\u2019s there and it\u2019s safe. And we will review it over time as well to make sure that we are ensuring that people\u2019s trust is maintained. But, you know, a lot of people use it already. This is about enshrining it in legislation and hopefully providing people with a really convenient way of proving who they are without sharing all their information many, many times over.     Updated at 10.48pm BST     10.39pm BST       Finance minister outlines plans for voluntary digital ID Finance minister Katy Gallagher was speaking to ABC News Breakfast just earlier about the government\u2019s plan to set up a national voluntary form of digital identification. She says this system already exists in an unregulated way (pointing to the myGov ID), but this would allow people to have a digital ID , enshrined in legislation, \u201cthat works across the economy\u201d.  It\u2019s regulated. People who participate are accredited [and] those important privacy protections are enshrined in legislation, as is the fact that it\u2019s voluntary and that government services need to continue to be provided in a range of ways so that people who don\u2019t want a digital ID don\u2019t have to have one.     Gallagher says the digital ID would be to provide \u201ca lot of documentation\u201d to different businesses or governments, and explains it this way:  The idea is that you would provide your ID [such as license, passport] and that would establish who you were. And then as you engage with other people that will be involved in the system \u2013 businesses, private companies, state and territory governments \u2013 you\u2019d be able to access that, the myGov ID system, as a way of verifying who you are. So you don\u2019t have to provide all those pieces of paper ID, or emailed ID, to all of those different providers, and thereby reducing the amount that you have to share about yourself. And also, you control how you engage with those companies using your myGov ID system.

He suggests national security should form part of the discussion because Australia is \u201cso reliant on imported fuels\u201d.  Price and choice [for electric vehicles] is largely due to us not having fuel efficiency standards. It\u2019s us and Russia, we don\u2019t have those standards, which means that we don\u2019t have the same sort of choice that Europe [has] when they go to buy an EV. And when it comes to range anxiety we need a lot more more charging stations. This is an opportunity for Australians to be saving thousands of dollars every year and I would argue that national security should come into this argument because we\u2019re currently just so reliant on imported fuels.

And I\u2019d say that the Coalition has not shown a willingness to work constructively with the government on difficult issues \u2026  Pocock says it\u2019s important for leaders to conduct this debate \u201cin a way that ensures that religious discrimination legislation doesn\u2019t become a culture war\u201d.  We\u2019ve seen it happen in the past and we know that some of the most vulnerable people in our community will suffer if that happens.

Rightly, there\u2019s a lot of Australians who are concerned about what that means for their family and friends who may want to come and visit Australia \u2026 We may want to move them to other countries, but we still have international obligations to them and should be respecting their human rights.

Leaked risk assessments carried out by Airservices Australia reveal travellers at 13 airports including Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide airports, were found to be at extreme risk if there was a fire or aircraft incident because of a lack of firefighting resources. Travellers at 14 other airports including Sydney, Canberra and Hobart were deemed to be at a \u201chigh risk\u201d. The leaked internal documents were revealed by the United Firefighters Union of Australia, which has warned that its members will conduct a four-hour strike from 6am on 15 April because of their concerns for the public\u2019s safety. Risk assessments were carried out between 2021 and 2022, but the union believes the problems remain to this day.    Union secretary Wes Garrett says Airservices Australia knew about the risk to travellers for two years, given the internal documents, but has publicly denied there are aviation firefighting shortages at airports.  These leaked documents confirm that Australia\u2019s air travellers face a dire risk every time they set foot on an aircraft in Australia. Clearly, this significant and ongoing risk to all Australian air travellers is unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue.  The documents show the risk assessments evaluate the minimum number of firefighting staff required to manage worst-case scenarios with four categories of risk: low, medium, high and extreme. The union is calling for changes to the enterprise agreement with Airservices to include new clauses, including minimum staffing requirements, set work hours and rostering, and changes to meet work health and safety regulations.

The draft strategy lays out a number of \u201ccommitments\u201d. Several key issues are raised about the diagnosis and identification of autism. The draft documents says autistic people and those around them can \u201cexperience difficulties\u201d in seeking or receiving a diagnosis, as well as in accessing support services. The document says early identification leads to better educational, social and economic outcomes, as well as better mental health and reduced stigma. Some points raised by those contributing to the report include \u201cinconsistent approaches\u201d to diagnosis, as well as varying levels of expertise of medical professionals, and the complexity and cost of the exercise. One major commitment area says the government would \u201cconsider the use and consistency of current identification screening, outcome and diagnostic tools\u201d, as well as working with professional bodies to \u201cdevelop a set of standardised co-designed training/professional development and resource materials\u201d for diagnosis. Other resources could be developed to support autistic people and their families. A final strategy, and subsequent action plan, is expected to be released late this year.

One key recommendation is for the federal government to \u201cwork with states and territories to improve service integration between the NDIS, foundational supports and mainstream services\u201d. The NDIS is not heavily mentioned in the report; it\u2019s understood this is because of feedback stressing the importance of the \u201cmainstream\u201d support services outside the NDIS.

That\u2019s how some anti-nuclear campaigners have framed concerns that the US and UK could dump waste here \u2013 claims the government rejects as fear mongering. Australia could become a \u201cpoison portal\u201d for international radioactive waste under the Aukus deal, a parliamentary inquiry into nuclear safety legislation has heard. The new laws would pave the way for waste from the nuclear subs to be stored in Australia but, with the US and UK struggling to deal with their own waste, campaigners fear Australia will be obliged to pick up the pieces. Property prices set a record high for a fifth consecutive month in March with the index compiled by CoreLogic showing a rise of 0.6%. Median home prices were $772,730, rebounding just over 10% since its most recent low. A separate index run by PropTrack produced similar results. National home prices were 0.34% higher in March to be up 6.79% from a year earlier, also a fresh peak. There\u2019ll be more focus on this as the day goes on with Reserve Bank assistant governor Christopher Kent making a speech at Bloomberg\u2019s offices in Sydney, while RBA minutes released at 11.30am will potentially shed more light on the next move in interest rates. South-east Australia is in for a drenching in the next few days as the storm front that has lashed Victoria since yesterday afternoon moves north. Melbourne recorded its driest March ever but Monday\u2019s downpour started the job of refilling reservoirs as many parts of the state saw thunderstorm warnings for more heavy rainfall, damaging wind gusts and large hail. The Geelong and Hawthorn AFL match at the MCG on Monday night was halted for about 40 minutes because of lightning, with players taken from the field and spectators urged to seek shelter.

Here is a wrap:  Back and forth ensued over the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, comparing a pro-Palestinian protest at the Sydney Opera House to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. Dutton defended the comparison today (\u201cI don\u2019t resile from that at all\u201d), while the federal education minister, Jason Clare, slammed it (\u201cif you want to run the country, you can\u2019t run your mouth\u201d). The Tasmanian premier, Jeremy Rockliff, said \u201cit is never appropriate to compare the Port Arthur tragedy with anything, in any circumstance,\u201d and the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties argued such statements \u201cdangerously conflate unrelated issues, leading to misinformation and unwarranted associations\u201d. The Australian Medical Association released new analysis showing private health insurers\u2019 management expenses and profits are the \u201ckey drivers of premium increases\u201d for customers. Tasmania\u2019s Liberals formally secured minority support, after independent MP and former Labor leader David O\u2019Byrne provided a written assurance of confidence and supply. A 36-year old woman was taken to hospital after a reported stabbing at Bondi beach. In another reported stabbing across the state, one teenage boy died and another was hospitalised in Sydney\u2019s west. New data revealed two-thirds of Tafe teachers are considering leaving the sector due to the ongoing impact of nearly a decade of Coalition cuts to public vocational education and pressure from the fee-free Tafe program. Save the Children Australia called on the Australian Government to urgently address rising starvation and malnutrition in Gaza, and avert a catastrophic famine in the occupied territory. And women in a Victorian community rocked by three recent killings demanded an end to male violence in a Ballarat rally.  That is all for today, see you next week.    Updated at 9.02am BST     8.35am BST       Vaping penalties should be kept in \u2018civil space\u2019 rather than criminal, police tell NSW inquiry Assistant commissioner Scott Cook said it was not known how much money organised criminal groups made from vapes while disputing claims that gangs controlled the market. He suggested penalties around vaping be kept in the \u201ccivil space\u201d, such as a licensing scheme under which suppliers could be threatened with cancellations.  The last thing we want to see as police is criminalisation of vaping, particularly for young people \u2013 it will bring them into contact with the criminal justice system they will never get out of.  The illicit market around tobacco and nicotine products with import restrictions was \u201cnowhere near the prohibited drugs illicit market\u201d, he added. Asked if police needed more power to control the sector, the assistant commissioner said: \u201cno, not at all.\u201d In addition to sufficient search and seizure powers, police had \u201csignificantly higher priorities than doing enforcement work for vapes\u201d, he said. The committee\u2019s deputy chair, Hugh McDermott, suggested those priorities were not for police to decide, adding that children as young as 11 were becoming addicted to illegally sold vapes due to a lack of enforcement. But Cook said if that was the government\u2019s position, then NSW Health should be resourced to do that properly. McDermott earlier noted industry representatives declined to appear at the inquiry. - AAP    Updated at 8.38am BST     8.17am BST       Holding the smoke, students find new way to hide vaping Attempts to combat vaping could have perverse outcomes as students try to avoid detection and organised criminals eye off a market that only recently became illicit. An inquiry has been told schools are taking a health-focused approach to getting children to quit while a senior police officer has warned against criminalisation. Students caught vaping at school were being offered health-based interventions, education department deputy secretary of student wellbeing Martin Graham told a NSW parliamentary committee today. \u201cThere\u2019s lot of vaping going on,\u201d he said.  The direction is not just about the education for why you shouldn\u2019t vape, but also, moving them onto cessation, so helping them to get off the vapes.  Graham said vaping had been added to behavioural policies with principals \u201cwho know their kids best\u201d entitled to suspend students. Schools with a specific need for vaping detectors in toilets can request them, but they provided a false sense of security and could drive more dangerous behaviour.  One that was brought to us by the young people and health professionals was suddenly a trend to try and hold the smoke in your lungs to avoid the detector \u2026 that\u2019s just making things way worse.  Enforcement since a crackdown started in January has primarily been handled by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and Border Force and, more locally, NSW Health. NSW police were mainly interested in retailers with suspected links to organised crime, which assistant commissioner Scott Cook told the inquiry might take an increased foothold in a now-illicit market. \u201cThe vape market, up until recently, was supplied on a legal basis \u2026 in other countries where these vapes are coming from, they\u2019re all legal,\u201d he said. - AAP (More to come)       8.04am BST    One teen dead, another hospitalised, after stabbing in Sydney\u2019s west    A teen has died and another is in serious condition after multiple stabbings near a school in Sydney\u2019s west. One person has been arrested, according to a NSW Police media release. Emergency services responded to the stabbings on Power Street, Doonside, about 3.40pm today. Before officers could arrive on scene, two teenage boys presented to Blacktown police station with stab wounds. They were treated at the scene for serious injuries. A teenage boy died at the scene, and the other was taken to hospital in a serious condition. Police have established crime scenes at both locations and are investigating. Inquiries are ongoing.    Updated at 8.15am BST     7.58am BST       Union denounces ACT government\u2019s appointment of robodebt official  The Community and Public Sector Union has called out the ACT government for its decision to appoint an official involved in the robodebt scandal, saying it could have a \u201cdetrimental impact\u201d on the union\u2019s dealings with the territory\u2019s administration and could \u201cundermine the confidence of public servants\u201d. The main public sector union has singled out the appointment of Lisa Carmody as the new deputy director general of the ACT government\u2019s central department as \u201calarming\u201d. During royal commissions hearings, Carmody, then the human service department\u2019s acting chief counsel, said she had brief discussions in early 2017 with the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) about concerns over the scheme\u2019s lawfulness. Ultimately, the AGS did not end up providing a legal opinion until late March 2019, more than two years later. The AGS said then the scheme was likely unlawful. The royal commission\u2019s final report, which found the scheme was \u201ccrude and cruel\u201d and illegal, did not make any adverse findings against Carmody. In a media release on Friday afternoon, the CPSU\u2019s ACT regional secretary, Maddy Northam, called on the ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, to reconsider the decision.  The CPSU is concerned that this appointment could have a detrimental impact on the ACT government\u2019s relationship with the union movement and undermine the confidence of public servants when raising concerns with management.  An ACT government spokesperson clarified Barr was not involved in the recruitment process and added the CPSU\u2019s assertions were not supported by the final robodebt report.  A nationwide search was undertaken to recruit for this role, including a full merit based assessment and due diligence process. The Robodebt Royal Commission final report does not support the assertions of the CPSU. When Ms Carmody commences in the role, she will look to actively engage with all key stakeholders.

On Wednesday, a spokesperson for Veterans\u2019 Affairs Minister Matt Keogh said he was concerned by the revelations:  The minister has requested an urgent briefing by the ANAO (Australian National Audit Office) on its findings and recommendations, and will discuss these with the Australian War Memorial\u2019s management as a priority.

The region, at the end of the River Murray in South Australia, provides vital habitat for a host of native aquatic and bird species, but is also used by some of the planet\u2019s most impressive travellers. Dozens of species that migrate from as far away as Siberia and Alaska visit the area each year, to feed and rest alongside native birds including the endangered Australasian bittern and the vulnerable sharp-tailed sandpiper. The money, for the Coorong, Lower Lakes, Murray Mouth and South-East landscape, will be used to improve shorebird and wetland habitat. Specifically, there will be new infrastructure on wetland and flood plain flats to increase the area and duration of quality shorebird and wetland habitat, among other things. The money will underpin Australia\u2019s commitment to international obligations including the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. The federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said:  Restoring the Murray Mouth, Lower Lakes and Coorong is a critical investment in the health of the whole system. This new project will ensure the survival of our internationally significant wetlands and the plants and animals who call them home.  - Australian Associated Press    Updated at 6.25am BST     6.13am BST       Thanks to Emily Wind for the day\u2019s blog coverage.

Take care, and enjoy your weekend.       6.04am BST       Advocacy groups call for \u2018programs and funding\u2019 in response to heat map Advocacy groups have welcomed the release of a heat map from the federal government (see earlier post) but are urging them to address the root cause of extreme heat \u2013 climate change. Emma Bacon, the executive director of Sweltering Cities, said certain communities are feeling the impacts of extreme heat more than others. She pointed to Western Sydney, facing \u201cclimate, health, housing and cost of living crises all at once\u201d.  In my experience, the people living in hot homes and hot suburbs across the country know that heatwaves are dangerous and that members of their community are at risk. People aren\u2019t underprepared for extreme heat through lack of knowledge, they\u2019re being prevented from following health advice because they\u2019re anxious about electricity bills so don\u2019t turn on air con, or they\u2019re renters and can\u2019t make simple upgrades to their homes to be more energy efficient.  The map demonstrates that some of the most dangerous areas are home to millions of people. We need to stop burning fossil fuels that contribute to rising temperatures and will make this crisis unmanageable for the public and the government. We cannot properly adapt to run-away global warming.   Bacon hopes the heat map will be a \u201cwake up call\u201d for the government, and said she is \u201ceagerly awaiting\u201d an announcement of how federal, state and territory governments will respond to the map \u201cwith programs and funding to help our communities be safe\u201d.         5.58am BST    Ballarat community unites against violence on women    Women in a Victorian community rocked by three recent killings are demanding an end to male violence, AAP reports, as a rally is to take place in Ballarat today. The Ballarat region\u2019s Samantha Murphy, Rebecca Young and Hannah McGuire have allegedly died at the hands of men since the beginning of February. A rally will begin at Ballarat train station today before gathering at nearby Camp Street, where family members of the victims, community leaders and family violence specialists will address the gathering. Organiser Sissy Austin, who was herself savagely attacked while on a run in 2023, said the issue was a national crisis:  Us Ballarat women, we\u2019re coming together to stand in solidarity, to feel less alone and to show the country we\u2019re united. We\u2019re here to fight for our rights to live safely in our community for generations to come. The Ballarat community aren\u2019t going to succumb to the violence that has been perpetrated in our town.  Austin said the three killings in a little over two months had stunned the community and \u201cwomen are living on eggshells\u201d.      Updated at 6.06am BST     5.29am BST       Australia Post changes \u2018big hit\u2019 to regional and remote areas, CDU professor says Regional and remote communities will be hit harder by Australia Post\u2019s move to deliver letters every second day, rather than every day, an academic says. Prof Steven Greenland from Charles Darwin University says while the impact may not be significant for major cities, services in regional and remote areas \u201ccould be significantly impacted\u201d.  Many of these do not have daily letter deliveries and collections already, and the collective impact of the cuts will create even greater delays, and especially during the high demand periods like Christmas.  Greenland said consumers and businesses need to be better prepared for the change and factor in greater lead times. He suggested people look at alternative online channels, but noted some consumers \u201cincluding the elderly may find it harder to switch\u201d.    As we reported earlier, the regulation change is effective from Monday, but the actual changes to deliveries will be progressively rolled out until the end of 2025. Posties will still come past homes every day as part of the changes. Australia Post said in a statement:  The new standards will not change the minimum number of post offices that Australia Post must maintain nationally and in rural, regional and remote areas, or the services available at Australia Post retail outlets.     Updated at 5.34am BST     5.20am BST       Continued from last post: Save the Children cited an example from more than a decade ago, when famine was declared in the Horn of Africa in 2011. Australia donated $112m to Somalia and neighbouring countries, making it the third-largest donor in the world in absolute terms. Despite the intervention, more than a quarter of a million people died in Somalia, about half of them children under five. And the Australian government later acknowledged it had acted too slowly. Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler said:  Australia\u2019s response to the famine in Somalia in 2011 serves as an important reminder that when there is political will, this country can step up and save lives. Unfortunately, it also serves as a reminder that once a famine is declared, many children will already be dead. In Gaza today, there are children already dying due to a lack of food or surviving only by eating animal feed and leaves while just a few kilometres away on the other side of the border, there are hundreds of trucks full of food, unable to deliver life-saving aid due to restrictions imposed by the government of Israel. The Australian government has not only a moral imperative to act but is also bound by its obligations under international humanitarian law, and the International Court of Justice ruling, to ensure that Palestinians are protected.  The Australian government has committed more than $52m in humanitarian assistance for civilians affected by the conflict in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, with a particular focus on providing essential supplies and support services in Gaza.    Updated at 5.25am BST     5.16am BST    Save the Children Australia urging further aid for Gaza amid rising starvation    Save the Children Australia has called on the Australian Government to urgently address rising starvation and malnutrition in Gaza, and avert a catastrophic famine in the occupied territory. As we flagged earlier, the child welfare NGO argues Australia should increase its humanitarian support to Gaza and apply greater pressure on the government of Israel to allow sufficient aid to reach those in need. The agency said:  Israel\u2019s systematic deprivation of aid to Gaza has led to one of the worst hunger crises in the world today, with recent IPC figures warning of imminent famine which may have already unfolded. Unless there is an immediate surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza, many more children could starve to death than have been killed by Israel\u2019s relentless bombardment over the past six months.

Albanese will walk the track alongside the Papua New Guinea prime minister, James Marape, before taking part in a dawn service. The trip, more than 80 years after troops fought along the rugged track to defend against a Japanese invasion, comes as Australia seeks closer ties with its closest neighbour. Albanese is set to be the first sitting prime minister to walk the famous track.    Kevin Rudd walked the Kokoda Track in 2006 while he was opposition leader as part of an appearance on Seven\u2019s Sunrise program, while former prime minister Scott Morrison also hiked the track in 2009 during his time as a backbench MP. The visit to Papua New Guinea comes after Albanese became the first Australian leader to address that country\u2019s parliament. Marape also gave a speech to federal parliament in February.

The survey, commissioned by the Australian Education Union (AEU), found full-time workers were clocking an average of around 43 hours per week - 19% higher than contracts and equating to almost a full day of unpaid labor. Less than one third (32%) of workers said their workload was \u201cmanageable most of the time\u201d, and two thirds were considering walking out of the profession altogether. The AEU is calling on the federal government to match its investment in Tafe students with the Tafe workforce. Its federal president, Correna Haythorpe, welcomed the large investment in Tafe made by the federal government but said \u201csignificant concerns\u201d remained among teachers about workload, job security, and the level of support required by students.  Australia\u2019s Tafe workers demonstrate extraordinary dedication and skill, but they are being pushed beyond their limits. After more than a decade of funding cuts by the previous Coalition government, Tafe teachers are carrying the burden.

The former ruckman, who played 285 games for St Kilda and Melbourne from 1963 to 1980, has been charged with three counts of indecent assault and one count of gross indecency. The Bayside sexual offences and child abuse investigation team laid the charges against the 78-year-old Moama man following an investigation into alleged historic child sex offences. The alleged incidents relate to one victim and took place at Heatherton, in Melbourne\u2019s south-east, in 1985, police said in a statement. The matter was heard in Melbourne magistrates court today and is due back in court in late June.

A statement from the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, the deputy premier, Susan Close, and the Greens\u2019 environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said the federal and state governments would work together to deliver the project. The $17m funding would go towards infrastructure, maintaining food webs and improving breeding habitat. \u200bClose said:  A number of important habitat restoration projects are already planned or well underway, and this new funding will add to the work being undertaken. It is vital that we help our wetland environments to thrive so they can remain strong into the future for the important wildlife that relies on them.     \u200bHanson-Young said the Greens had spend years working to \u201cprotect this area from corporate greed and overextraction\u201d.

Updated at 4.26am BST     4.05am BST    Dutton\u2019s Port Arthur comparison \u2018disrespectful to broader Australian public\u2019: NSWCCL    The New South Wales\u2019 Council for Civil Liberties has denounced opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s decision to compare a pro-Palestine protest to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. President Lydia Shell said Dutton\u2019s comments were both insensitive to the victims and survivors of the Port Arthur tragedy, but also \u201cdisrespectful to the broader Australian public\u201d. In a statement, the council argued such statements \u201clack factual basis\u201d and \u201cdangerously conflate unrelated issues, leading to misinformation and unwarranted associations\u201d. Shell said in a statement:  The Port Arthur massacre stands as one of Australia\u2019s darkest moments, and any attempt to exploit its memory for political gain or to deflect from critical discussions is deeply concerning\u2026 It is essential to distinguish between legitimate expressions of political dissent, such as protests advocating for a ceasefire in Palestine, and heinous acts of violence like the Port Arthur massacre. Drawing parallels or suggesting connections where none exist not only undermines public confidence in our civil institutions, but also risks inciting division within our communities.     Shell said parliamentarians must \u201cresist the urge to exploit the senseless loss of human life for their own political purposes\u201d.  The leader of the opposition\u2019s disgraceful comments tarnish the position he holds and the party he represents. We urge Mr. Dutton and all political leaders to refrain from furthering divisive narratives and to focus on addressing pressing issues with integrity and respect for democratic values.

Chief minister Eva Lawler said the Alice Springs community would continue to see a \u201chigh-visibility police presence\u201d even once the youth curfew ends. This will include 25 additional police officers stationed at Alice Springs until the end of June. These will come from other policing units across the Northern Territory. Support service Territory Families will have additional resources on the ground, with additional staff from 10pm to 6am every night. A safety hub will be established in the mall.

The fear that I could feel, the conversations that I could hear when I came to Alice Springs the next day \u2026 I will continue to work with the police commissioner, with the agency heads, and in the future, those decisions will be able to be made. We tried a curfew. It was high risk to try a curfew, it wasn\u2019t something we knew whether it would work or not. But there was a reluctance in the past to have a curfew. We\u2019ve seen it be successful in Alice Springs so of course, if we\u2019ve got that string to our bow, I\u2019m more than happy as chief minister to do it again.

There will continue to be \u2026 officers at every bottle shop in Alice Springs. There will be 25 additional police officers stationed in Alice Springs until the end of June \u2026 We know the additional officers in Alice Springs have made a difference. Territory Families have also had additional resources on the ground. They had the co-responders, but additional staff on the ground from 10:00pm to 6:00am every night in Alice Springs, and that will continue as well. We\u2019re going to establish a community safety hub in the mall. That will provide a visible presence of people such as traditional owners, but also police auxiliaries, Territory Families staff, engagement officers, we\u2019ll have people in the mall providing that support to the community as well.

Vegetables had the largest drop (14 grams per person per day), followed by fruit (down 12 grams), milk products (down 11 grams), and non-alcoholic beverages (down 9 grams). Australians bought around 3.9% less food in 2022-23 than in the previous year \u2013 that is a a drop of 63 grams, or 337kJ, a day. Are we all on a diet, or is it just the cost of living crisis? Paul Atyeo, ABS health statistics spokesperson, says it is part of a longer-term trend:  Many of the foods that dropped during 2022-23 are part of longer-term trends. We\u2019re consuming between 5 and 8 per cent less cow\u2019s milk, bread and fruit juice per person compared to 2018-19.  Australians are still having more of certain foods than we did five years ago.

New Zealand is considering membership of pillar 2 of the Aukus pact \u2013 along with Japan, Canada and South Korea \u2013 which would develop and share advanced military technology. As we flagged earlier, NZ foreign minister Winston Peters and US secretary of state Antony Blinken issued a joint statement noting there were \u201cpowerful reasons\u201d for New Zealand to \u201cengage practically\u201d with Aukus. But New Zealand\u2019s proud and bipartisan anti-nuclear stance \u2013 which extends to banning nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed ships in Kiwi waters \u2013 will put it at odds with its only formal defence ally, Australia, by next decade.    In an interview with Stuff\u2019s Tova podcast, Morrison said he would welcome a debate in New Zealand to be more accepting of nuclear technology:  These things are always worth looking at. I appreciate that it\u2019s a very sensitive issue in New Zealand and it\u2019s got quite a history. In Australia, under the new leader of the Liberal party, Peter Dutton, they have engaged in a discussion about a civil nuclear industry in Australia [and] it\u2019s progressing in a very mature way \u2026 I [have] no reason to believe why New Zealand couldn\u2019t equally consider doing that.  Morrison said a debate would have to be \u201cguided by the national interest\u201d, with bipartisanship necessary given the long-term nature of the commitment. He also said whether or not New Zealand signed up to Aukus pillar 2, the country could \u201cbe involved in a practical capacity\u201d.

Rockliff, a Liberal premier, said such a comparison should not have been made to the massacre. He told ABC Radio:  It is never appropriate to compare the Port Arthur tragedy with anything, in any circumstance. This is still raw for many Tasmanians and will be forever raw with those who are directly affected. It\u2019s up to Mr Dutton in terms of clarifying what he has said. My view is we need to be very careful and never compare the Port Arthur tragedy to anything but the absolutely tragedy that it was.

Australia Post has clarified the rollout of this change for us. A spokesperson said the regulation change is effective from Monday, but the actual changes to deliveries will be progressively rolled out until the end of 2025. CEO Paul Graham said the previous regulations requiring Australia Post to deliver letters every day, even when there were no letters to deliver, had been causing \u201csignificant financial losses\u201d.

Updated at 1.43am BST     1.33am BST       Compulsory income management in NT \u2018ineffective in reducing harm\u2019, study finds A study led by Charles Darwin University (CDU) has found that compulsory income management (CIM) in the Northern Territory is perceived as ineffective in reducing harm. The study interviewed 26 people who are experts in social welfare programs, who provide support to welfare recipients or have an in-depth understanding of CIM in the lives of welfare recipients. CIM was established in the NT in 2007 and restricts a portion of someone\u2019s income support payment that cannot be used to gamble, purchase alcohol and other prohibited products. Lead author Dr Steven Roche said the study concluded CIM was considered a punitive approach to reducing harm and was incompatible with the needs of welfare recipients:  The findings detail CIM\u2019s negligible impact on behaviour change around social harms and suggest that CIM can exacerbate issues such as family violence, where CIM is weaponised by men who use violence in situations of family violence.     According to Roche, study participants said welfare recipients found ways to bypass CIM to purchase prohibited items, that CIM doesn\u2019t prevent or reduce family violence, and it doesn\u2019t address the underlying issues of harm from alcohol and other drugs.  A policy reform agenda involving genuine community consultation is desperately needed to better understand the complexities of CIM in the NT that holds principles of community-based policy development at its heart.        1.24am BST    AMA says private health insurers\u2019 management expenses and profits are \u2018key drivers of premium increases\u2019    The Australian Medical Association has released new analysis showing skyrocketing management expenses for private health insurers, and said patients are being hit with rising bills as a result. The analysis shows management expenses for private health insurers rose 32% over the last four years to June 2023 \u2013 an increase of $716m. While patients pay more for their cover, the AMA data shows health insurers have recorded a 50.2% increase in profits over the same four-year period. By contrast, the amount insurers paid out in medical services and hospital treatment benefits increased by just 3.6% and 8.1% respectively.    AMA president Professor Stephen Robson said:  When patients pay their insurance premiums, they expect that money is going mostly towards the costs of benefits for treatment and hospital stays, but what this graph shows is that management expenses and insurance profits are key drivers of premium increases.Private health is a major part of Australia\u2019s world-leading health system, and we understand the need for insurers to be profitable, but these numbers show something has gone very wrong and that significant reform is needed.  The AMA is urging the federal government to mandate private health insurers return a minimum 90%, on average, of premium dollars paid each year back to the consumer in the form of rebates and benefits.

It said:  Young Labor Left NSW expresses grave concerns over the proposed amendments to the Migration Act and opposes its passage into law. These measures would only serve to further criminalise refugees and asylum seekers within this country and see these people in indefinite detention and/or at the whims of the persecution that they sought to flee from ... The youth of this party refuse to co-sign on this government\u2019s attempt to ram through sweeping powers to punish potentially hundreds of refugees and non-citizens.  The submission notes that it is not a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d to the new offence of failing to cooperate in deportation that a person \u201chas a genuine fear of suffering persecution or significant harm\u201d. This amounts to \u201can intentional and concerted effort to target asylum seekers and threaten them with imprisonment if they do not comply with removal even if they have well-founded concerns for the lives of themselves and their families\u201d, it said. It said in the case of ASF17 \u2013 the man challenging detention in the high court \u2013 \u201cthis amendment will extend immigration detention indefinitely\u201d, which it said was \u201cinhumane\u201d. The submission said the bill is a \u201cdirect breach of the ALP national platform\u201d, citing the mandatory minimum of one year in prison. It concluded:  The bill represents a gross, miscalculated and cruel attempt to fix an issue within the refugee system that will only exacerbate said issue. It cannot be, in good conscience, allowed to pass into law.  And to think in Anthony Albanese and Andrew Giles there is a Labor left prime minister and immigration minister, so this heat comes from their own faction.

Grassroots group Students Against Placement Poverty has lobbied for years that mandatory unpaid placements, usually spanning hundreds of hours, should be compensated. Earlier this year, the Universities Accord final report backed their recommendations, suggesting students completing placements in care courses like nursing and teaching should receive a commonwealth stipend.

Social work student Isaac Wattenberg said the cost of living was \u201csky-high\u201d.  It\u2019s unaffordable and unsustainable for my peers and I to take months off paid work to complete mandatory unpaid placements. Students will no longer accept being exploited.

They\u2019re two separate issues. Port Arthur was a shocking, murderous, evil act in Australia.

Speaking on the Today show, Dutton stood by his remark and said the comparison was a commentary on the prime minister\u2019s leadership:  The point I was making \u2013 which is absolutely a legitimate one \u2013 is that I thought this was a time for the prime minister to show leadership and to step up. Instead, we\u2019ve had crickets. You\u2019ve got a contrast, I think, with John Howard, who stood up at a point of national importance for our country, demonstrated leadership and changed the course of history for the better.     While acknowledging criticism about his reference to Australia\u2019s worst mass shooting, Dutton doubled down. He argued Anthony Albanese had failed to act to reduce antisemitism in the community in the wake of the Gaza conflict:  That\u2019s the parallel that I\u2019m making \u2013 to the absolute absence of leadership from the prime minister at the moment, which has given rise to those in the Jewish community talking about feeling unsafe in our country.

He claimed that Anthony Albanese has \u201cmade a false moral equivalence\u201d between Islamophobia and antisemitism:  They\u2019re both equally morally repugnant, that\u2019s clear, but one of them is much more prevalent.  It should be noted that data shows that both Islamophobia and antisemitism have been on the rise since the 7 October attack last year:   Related: Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents record large spike in Australia, advocates say    Q: Then why not talk about antisemitism on its own merits rather than comparing it to a mass shooting from a different time and context? Paterson responded:  Or, to take a different approach, why not talk about antisemitism on its own merits without always comparing it to Islamophobia, when we know that it\u2019s a far more prevalent problem in our community?  Paterson is asked to acknowledge Islamophobia has been longstanding in some parts of Australia:  Yes absolutely, it is a longstanding problem in Australia and it has increased since 7 October, but just nowhere near as much as antisemitism has [been].

Paterson told ABC RN Dutton\u2019s speech distinguished the two by stating there were no deaths at the protest, but it was \u201ccomparable on its social impact on Australia\u201d. He argued Anthony Albanese had failed to unite the country \u201cin response to a crisis of antisemitism\u201d in the way John Howard once united people for action against gun violence. Asked if he could understand the backlash, particularly from families affected by the Port Arthur massacre who had found the comparison offensive, Paterson said he would \u201cencourage people to read the speech\u201d. He was also asked to respond to comments from his Liberal colleague Bridget Archer, who labelled Dutton\u2019s comments \u201cincredibly disrespectful\u201d and \u201cwholly inappropriate\u201d.

Updated at 11.10pm BST     10.54pm BST       Angus Taylor defends Dutton\u2019s comparison between Port Arthur and pro-Palestine protest Liberal MP Angus Taylor has defended the opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s decision to compare a pro-Palestine protest on 9 October to the Port Arthur massacre, to make a point about the government\u2019s need to seize important matters. Speaking on ABC RN earlier this morning, Taylor labelled Dutton\u2019s speech as a \u201cclarion call\u201d to \u201cstand up against the rising tide of antisemitism in the country\u201d.  Which is something that [the] prime minister has failed to do.  Taylor said Dutton\u2019s argument was that the former prime minister John Howard \u201cshowed the moral leadership that was needed\u201d following the Port Arthur massacre but Anthony Albanese had \u201cbeen weak\u201d.  So the call here is for moral leadership, and I don\u2019t think we have seen that from Anthony Albanese.

Thanks for reading along and join us back here tomorrow. Here\u2019s what happened today: \n   \n   The Albanese government has appointed Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin as a special adviser to look at the \u201csufficiency and appropriateness\u201d of Israel\u2019s response to its strikes that killed Australian humanitarian worker Zomi Frankcom.  \n   Anthony Albanese said Australia expects full cooperation from the Israeli defence force and that it is \u201cin Israel\u2019s interest\u201d for there to be transparency around the deaths. \n   Craig Emerson\u2019s interim supermarket review found the existing voluntary food and grocery code was \u201cnot effective\u201d and that the code should be mandatory and come with \u201cheavy penalties\u201d including fines of up to $10m. Opposition leader Peter Dutton called the report commissioned by Labor a \u201cMickey Mouse review\u201d. \n   A major flood warning remains current for the Warrego River, which comes as parts of south-west Queensland face major flooding. \n   Residents are continuing to return to their homes north-west of Sydney and along the Hawkesbury River after a weekend of wild weather which saw floods damage more than 60 homes in the greater Sydney region, leaving 17 uninhabitable. \n   A 21-year-old man has been charged with the murder of 23-year-old Hannah McGuire, after a woman\u2019s body was found in a burned out car in bushland at Scarsdale, 25km south of Ballarat, on Friday morning. \n   \n  \n Updated at 9.06am BST \n \n \n  8.23am BST  \n  \n  The Afternoon Update, with a news roundup of what\u2019s happened today, is live. \n   \n    Related: Afternoon Update: NSW opens first drug checking service, Qantas\u2019s frequent flyer revamp; and Woody the sheep\u2019s three years on the run  \n   \n  If you haven\u2019t already, you can subscribe to the Afternoon Update newsletter, which will bring it to your inbox every day, and you can start your day with our Morning Mail newsletter by subscribing here. \n  \n \n \n  8.01am BST  \n  \n  EPA issues warning to councils after asbestos found in Melbourne parks \n  Victoria\u2019s environment watchdog is warning local councils to tighten quality controls on potential asbestos in mulch, as it investigates suspected illegal dumping of the contaminated material, which has been discovered at several parks. \n  The Victorian Environment Protection Authority on Sunday said it had ordered Hobsons Bay council, in Melbourne\u2019s west, to hand over records of its supply chain for mulch production and conduct wider testing for asbestos, after the material was found in several reserves in the council area. \n  The EPA on Monday said its inspections uncovered contaminated material at six parks, five in the Hobsons Bay council area and one in Merri-bek council, in Melbourne\u2019s north. The EPA has sent materials containing suspected asbestos from four sites to be tested, with results expected on Tuesday. \n  Full story here: \n   \n    Related: EPA issues warning to councils after asbestos found in Melbourne parks  \n   \n  \n \n \n  7.47am BST  \n 21-year-old man charged with murder of Hannah McGuire \n  \n  A 21-year-old man has been charged with murder after a woman\u2019s body was found in a burned out car in regional Victoria, AAP reports. \n  Emergency services were called to a vehicle on fire in bushland at Scarsdale, 25km south of Ballarat, on Friday morning. \n  The remains of a 23-year-old Clunes woman were located inside the car. She has been identified as Hannah McGuire. \n  Two Sebastopol men, aged 21 and 22, were arrested shortly before 5pm on Sunday. \n  The 22-year-old man was later released, while the 21-year-old man was charged with murder on Monday afternoon. \n  Investigators will allege the man charged knew McGuire. \n  The charged man will appear in Ballarat magistrates court on Tuesday. \n  \n Updated at 9.04am BST \n \n \n  7.36am BST  \n  \n  No date yet for the prime ministerial wedding \n  One last, and more light-hearted, moment from the interview with Anthony Albanese on ABC Afternoons, that has just wrapped up. \n  In closing, he was asked whether he and his fiancee Jodie Haydon had had a chance over the Easter weekend to set a date for their wedding. \n  The prime minister was not biting. \n  \u201cI can confirm that I will not be discussing the date with yourself or anyone else on a TV program,\u201d he said. \u201cDiaries bounce around and the difficult task of setting a date as prime minister is something that is ahead of us.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  7.29am BST  \n  \n  Coalition\u2019s stalling on migration bill \u2018beyond comprehension\u2019, PM says \n  Anthony Albanese is being asked on the ABC about boat arrivals to Australia, after criticism from the opposition that government policies have created a \u201cpull factor\u201d. \n  While refusing to comment on reports that about 10 people arrived on the mainland, the prime minister has said that \u201cpeople who come as unauthorised boat arrivals in Australia will not be allowed to be settled here\u201d. \n   \n   We want to make it very, very clear that there is no incentive on coming to Australia by boat, that people won\u2019t be allowed to settle here. Because we don\u2019t want people risking their lives and we also don\u2019t want the quite evil trade of people smuggling to be able to profit from such activities. \n   \n  Asked whether the government\u2019s stalled deportation measures contained in the migration bill that failed to pass the Senate before Easter could have been marketed by people smugglers, Albanese was critical of the Coalition for refusing to vote for the bill. \n   \n   We put forward that legislation in good faith. It passed through the House of Representatives on one day and then the Coalition changed their mind and deferred it on the very next day. \n   The Coalition need to explain why it is that they deferred that legislation given that they have failed to come up a single policy disagreement that is in that legislation. It is beyond my comprehension how it is that the Coalition have contradicted their own rhetorical position by not passing this legislation. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.40am BST \n \n \n  7.20am BST  \n  \n  The prime minister is responding to a question about whether Israel is being held to a higher standard than Hamas in its conduct of war, as opposition foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, said on the weekend. \n   \n   Hamas are a terrorist organisation and that is why they are outlawed. They don\u2019t respect the rule of law and they are an organisation that targets civilians and with the atrocities that occurred on October 7, which is why we unequivocally condemn it. \n   Democratic nations have different responsibilities. They have responsibilities to comply with international law and that is what we expect of Israel. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.23am BST \n \n \n  7.15am BST  \n Transparency around Zomi Frankcom's death 'in Israel's interest': Albanese \n  \n  Anthony Albanese says that Mark Binskin is well regarded globally and that Australia expects full cooperation from the Israeli defence force and their authorities, as Binskin participates in the investigation into the aid worker deaths. \n   \n   We are confident that that will be made available. Because it is in Israel\u2019s interest as well for there to be transparency around these incidents. They have shaken the world. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.18am BST \n \n \n  7.12am BST  \n  \n  Prime minister calls for \u2018proper accountability\u2019 from Israel over deaths of aid workers \n  Anthony Albanese is speaking on ABC Afternoons at the moment about the appointment of former ADF chief Mark Binskin as a special adviser to look at the \u201csufficiency and appropriateness\u201d of Israel\u2019s response to its strikes that killed Australian Zomi Frankcom and six of her World Central Kitchen colleagues. \n  He is calling Frankcom\u2019s death a \u201ctragedy\u201d that has \u201cshaken the world\u201d and says that the Australian government does not find Israel\u2019s investigation into the deaths to be satisfactory. \n   \n   This is a tragedy. You have Zomi Frankcom, who was there, working, supporting her fellow humans. Doing work in Gaza, providing aid in a way that should have kept her safe. \n   She did everything possible to do the right thing, as did her organisation, and we had circumstances where one car was hit then another car was hit, then a third car was hit. \n   We need proper accountability, we need full transparency about the circumstances and I think that is what the Australian public would expect. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.52am BST \n \n \n  6.55am BST  \n  \n  Strong number of first home buyers enter property market, February ABS data shows \n  A fresh batch of data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics released today shows that first home buyers are making it on to the property ladder in respectable numbers, despite affordability challenges, AAP reports. \n  The ABS recorded a 4.3% uptick in the number of new loan commitments to first-time owner-occupier purchasers in February. \n  While this followed a 5.6% fall in January, first home buyer loan numbers were 13.2% higher than a year ago. \n  With more than 9,300 first home buyer loan commitments recorded over the month, activity was well down from the highs reached in January 2021 but broadly in line with pre-pandemic levels. \n  National Australia Bank senior markets economist Taylor Nugent said lending approvals for first home buyers had proved resilient. \n  He said this suggested higher mortgage rates were not proving much of a hurdle, or at least compared to the rising cost of renting. \n  \u201cHigher mortgage rates and affordability constraints are being offset by tightness in rental markets and underlying strength in housing demand,\u201d said Nugent. \n  Reflecting higher house prices, the value of loans to first home buyers rose 4.8% over the month to be 20.7% higher annually. \n  CommSec economists Ryan Felsman and Craig James said demand for homes continued to rise given a \u201crelatively firm job market, a healthy stock of savings and rising migration offsetting higher interest rates\u201d. \n  They said it was a promising sign first home buyers remained active. \n  \u201cThere is a general perception that interest rates have peaked, and this may be seeing greater urgency by homebuyers to secure their purchase, fearful of a more significant influx of buyers when interest rates actually start their descent,\u201d they added. \n  \n Updated at 7.04am BST \n \n \n  6.41am BST  \n  \n  Car industry lobby head grilled over letter to Labor about vehicle efficiency standards \n  The head of the car industry\u2019s main lobbying group has been questioned about how a document \u2013 which warned Labor of the political risks of its proposed vehicle efficiency standards \u2013 was given to the energy minister Chris Bowen\u2019s office. \n  The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries has been one of the key bodies critical of the proposed changes designed to improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles and bring down overall transport emissions. \n  Appearing at a parliamentary inquiry into lobbying on Monday, its chief executive, Tony Weber, was presented with the document obtained by former senator, Rex Patrick, under freedom of information (FoI). \n  The document, which contains no letterhead or date, outlines the \u201cpolitical risks\u201d of introducing a \u201charsh\u201d standard, warning consumers would blame the government for any loss of choice or increase in the cost of cars. \n  It reads: \u201cThe issue is like the Voice \u2013 most people are supportive of the concept, until they see the detail. Once it becomes a cost of living and consumer choice argument, it\u2019s dead.\u201d \n  It also describes carmakers, referred to as original equipment manufacturers or OEMs, as \u201calmost schizophrenic\u201d on the introduction of vehicle efficiency standards. \n  \u201cMany OEMs will be privately critical of the policy settings in this area but will publicly position themselves from a marketing perspective to embrace it. This leads to the announcements of EVs that are planned in a situation where there are no real plans to actually build and provide them.\u201d \n  ACT senator David Pocock asked Weber why the document was allegedly given in hard copy, and had no letterhead or date. Pocock also asked whether it had been given to the minister\u2019s office informally by a lobbyist in Parliament House. Pocock suggested it was done so to avoid being captured in an FoI \u2013 which was unsuccessful. \n  Weber said he needed time to read the document but did not dispute it had come from the peak body. Weber said it could have been a background document provided in a meeting with officials but took other questions on notice around its origin and how it was handed to the minister\u2019s office. \n  \n Updated at 6.45am BST \n \n \n  6.24am BST  \n  \n  Hello, I\u2019m Kate Lyons and will be seeing you through until the end of the day. \n  In case you missed it and are in need of a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, Eliza Spencer, from our rural network, has this utterly delightful story about Woody the (formerly) escaped merino sheep. \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n   \n  The sheep was found wandering the streets of Woodstock, a small New South Wales town on the central tablelands late last year. \n  At some point he had escaped the shared community paddock and taken up residence near the local tip, relying on food and water left by residents. \n  Prompted by concern about his large fleece, authorities decided to bring him in. \n  Volunteers from the Woodstock Rural fire service began the chase on Wednesday, and a livestock transporter, Matthew Blazley, made the capture. \n  Woody is well, and was sheared of about 10kg of wool, having missed an estimated three shearing seasons. \n  Full story here: \n   \n    Related: On the lam: Woody the escaped merino shorn after community-wide chase  \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.26am BST \n \n \n  6.00am BST  \n  \n  Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, the lovely Kate Lyons will be here to take you through the rest of our rolling coverage.

The samples will then be sent for further confirmatory testing of the drug makeup. \n   Drug checking, including pill testing, saves lives. People can find out what substances the drugs they have been sold contain without fear of law enforcement action. Drug testing services also allow trained staff to talk candidly to them free of judgment about why they are using drugs and explain the many risks involved. Many people who submit drugs for testing discard them when they find out what they contain. \n   \n  Dr Hoffman called on the NSW government to follow Queensland and the ACT by introducing drug testing services featuring fixed and mobile sites across NSW. \n  \n Updated at 6.03am BST \n \n \n  5.49am BST  \n  \n  Road and rail disruptions continue following east coast floods \n  Sticking with the east coast floods: road and rail disruptions are continuing, with parts of the South Coast train line remaining closed due to flood damage. \n   \n   \n    The wild weather over the weekend caused some significant flooding on the South Coast line.&nbsp;Thanks to the local community for your patience as we work to clean up the damage, with buses replacing trains south of Waterfall while we work to restore services as quickly as possible pic.twitter.com/Es4BIy3CR4\u2014 Transport for NSW (@TransportforNSW) April 8, 2024\n    \n   \n  Bulldozers are set to cut through a temporary evacuation road in the Blue Mountains-Megalong Valley after a land slip shut off the only access road, isolating hundreds of residents. \n  The Blue Mountains mayor, Mark Greenhill, said cutting a temporary road through rock would take three days and would be contingent on careful geotechnical advice.

What the prime minister is doing here is trying to find a pathway through what is obviously a torn ALP. \n   The caucus of the Australian Labor Party is split at the moment \u2026 what we have seen here by the prime minister is a political response and, frankly, while Mark Binskin is an excellent public servant and is beyond reproach, an incredible individual, he has been given mission impossible by this prime minister because the prime minister is after a political outcome for what is obviously a lot of anxious and difficulty within the left wing of his Labor caucus. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.39am BST \n \n \n  5.33am BST  \n Dutton doubles down on claim supermarket review was \u2018predetermined\u2019 \n  \n  Continuing from our last post, Dutton also argued the review was a \u201cMickey-Mouse review\u201d: \n   \n   [What] we\u2019ve got at the moment is a government with a predetermined outcome for a review conducted by Craig Emerson, you may as well have asked Wayne Swan to conduct a review. \n   The review was written, the results were dictated by Jim Chalmers and I think this is a Mickey-Mouse review that has been conducted by Labor\u2026 \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.40am BST \n \n \n  5.27am BST  \n  \n  Dutton calls Emerson response \u2018political response from political mate of the Labor party\u2019 \n  Dutton also argued the interim report has delivered a \u201cpolitical response\u201d to the supermarkets issue.

The [LDA] will measure the regolith\u2019s ability to propagate an electric field, which is a key parameter in the search for lunar volatiles, especially ice. \n   \n  This LDA experiment will gather essential information about the structure of the moon\u2019s subsurface, monitor dielectric changes caused by the changing angle of the sun as the Moon rotates, and look for possible frost formation or ice deposits. \n  Culton said Artemis III experiments will collect \u201cvaluable scientific data about the lunar environment, the lunar interior, and how to sustain a long-duration human presence on the Moon\u201d. \n   \n   This will help prepare Nasa to \u2018live off the land\u2019 as its astronauts establish a permanent presence on the Moon, and later explore Mars. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.17am BST \n \n \n  5.04am BST  \n  \n  BoM says Tropical Cyclone Olga unlikely to cross into Western Australia \n  The Bureau of Meteorology has shared a video update on Tropical Cyclone Olga, located off the coast of Western Australia.

An autopsy showed the Gomeroi 17-year-old died from a traumatic head injury. An inquest into his death returned open findings in 1989. \n  A stolen car was found nearby and police concluded the teenager had laid on the tracks either deliberately or in a dazed state, something his family has never believed. His sister Lorna Haines said the family hoped this inquest would be their \u201cpath to justice\u201d. \n   \n   My family have been waiting 36 long years to find out the truth about what happened that night. We hope that the coroner will not rest until all the facts come out. All we want is accountability and truth. \n   \n  The latest inquest began in Tamworth today, before the deputy state coroner, Harriet Grahame. Directly addressing Haines\u2019 family in court, Grahame said she was taking the task of finding out what happened to the teenager \u201cextremely seriously\u201d. \n   \n   I know how long you have been working towards this day and I acknowledge your perseverance and resilience. \n   \n  In his opening statement, counsel assisting the coroner Chris McGorey said it was likely someone had more information about Mark\u2019s death. \n  McGorey said one of the key questions for the inquest was how Mark came to be on the tracks.

During extreme weather events, large numbers can die and release toxic amounts of ammonia. \n   \n  Booth pointed to a research paper published in 2022 that suggested the global cost of the pest was more than $US12bn over the past 40 years. She says that\u2019s an underestimate, given costs have mostly only been documented in North America. \n  - from AAP \n  \n Updated at 4.46am BST \n \n \n  4.22am BST  \n No plan to eradicate pest that can muscle in on natives \n  \n  There will be no attempt to eradicate a new exotic pest that could threaten river health and water infrastructure in Australia, AAP reports. \n  Authorities announced the country\u2019s first detection of the highly invasive freshwater gold clam in mid-February, saying it had been detected at several locations in the Brisbane River. \n  The fast-growing, prolific breeder had been on a list of priority exotic pests Australia wanted to keep out due to its capacity for environmental harm. \n  A single clam can produce 400 offspring a day and up to 70,000 a year, meaning they can quickly form large populations capable of blocking waterways, driving down water quality, and crowding out native species. \n  It has now emerged the pest was in the Brisbane River for a year before its presence was confirmed. The decision not to attempt eradication was made in January before the public learned of its arrival. \n  So far it\u2019s not believed to have spread beyond the Ipswich region of the river. \n  The federal agriculture and fisheries department says the National Biosecurity Management Consultative Committee met in January and agreed eradication from Queensland was not technically feasible, because the clam is now \u201cwell established\u201d in the Brisbane River and because of the lack of effective eradication methods. \n   \n   Freshwater gold clam has not been successfully eradicated from any locality it has invaded globally. \n   \n  In March, the Queensland department said work had started on a national surveillance and preparedness strategy to manage the clam\u2019s spread and impact. \n  \n Updated at 4.24am BST \n \n \n  4.07am BST  \n  \n  Summary of the interim supermarket report\u2019s findings \n  We\u2019ve been talking a lot about the interim supermarket report today, courtesy of Craig Emerson. The government established a review into the food and grocery code earlier this year which Emerson was appointed to lead, and his findings were released today. \n  In case you\u2019ve just joined us, here are some of Emerson\u2019s key findings, as outlined by AAP: \n   \n   The existing voluntary food and grocery code designed to ensure grocery retailers and wholesalers treat suppliers fairly is \u201cnot effective\u201d. \n   A \u201cheavy imbalance\u201d exists between suppliers and the concentrated supermarket sector. \n   The code should be mandatory with \u201cheavy penalties\u201d for major breaches by supermarkets with revenues higher than $5bn \u2013 a threshold capturing Coles, Woolworths, Aldi and wholesaler Metcash. \n   A serious or systemic breach should attract fines as high as $10m or 10% of a supermarket\u2019s annual turnover or three times the benefit gained from breaking the rules, whatever is greater. \n   The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission would enforce the code; \n   The code should better protect suppliers, especially from retribution from supermarkets. \n   The existing code does not contain penalties for breaches but does offer compensation of up to $5m if a supplier wins a dispute, although compensation has never been paid. \n   The report does not support forced divestiture powers, noting it could force large incumbents to sell stores to other large players and increase market concentration rather than reduce it. \n   \n  The final report is due to be released in June. \n   \n    Related: Australia\u2019s big supermarkets could face penalties of up to $10m under proposed mandatory code  \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.17am BST \n \n \n  3.58am BST  \n Major flooding at Warrego River in south-west Queensland \n  \n  As we reported earlier, a major flood warning remains current for the Warrego River.

The treasurer also confirmed \u201csubstantial changes to the mergers regime\u201d will be announced this week. \n  The assistant minister for competition, Andrew Leigh, said the Harper, Hilmer and Dawson reviews didn\u2019t recommend divestiture powers, which are also opposed by the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. \n  Leigh accused the Nationals of being \u201ctigers in opposition, but kittens in the cabinet\u201d, because they settled for a voluntary code of conduct in the Coalition\u2019s decade in office. \n  Earlier, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, labelled forced divestiture \u201ca populist response\u201d, suggesting that forcing Woolworths or Coles to sell a regional store to its competitor could lead to \u201cincreased concentration\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 3.14am BST \n \n \n  2.45am BST  \n  \n  Federation University faces backlash over plans to cut one in 10 staff members \n  Federation University is facing growing backlash after announcing plans to cut 200 ongoing positions \u2013 the equivalent of just over one in 10 staff members. \n  A spokesperson for the Ballarat university said the announcement came in response to an ongoing decline in student numbers which had been exacerbated by \u201cunexpected but necessary changes to international student visa arrangements\u201d. \n  The number of international students attending Federation University fell by 49% between 2019 and 2023, causing a drop of around $80m to university revenue. \n   \n   This is not sustainable \u2026 the aim is to return the university to surplus by 2026 which will allow for strengthened investment in the student experience, technology, high-quality teaching and research. \n   This transformation requires difficult decisions and we acknowledge the impact of these on our people and communities and we will be doing everything we can to support them through the process. \n   \n  National Tertiary Education Union members at Federation University have called for the resignation of vice-chancellor Duncan Bentley after the proposed cuts, vowing to use \u201call available means\u201d to push back including rallies and possible legal measures.Dr Mathew Abbott, president of Federation University\u2019s NTEU branch, said the university \u201csimply cannot sustain cuts of this scale\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 3.08am BST \n \n \n  2.37am BST  \n Victorian environment watchdog addresses media after asbestos found in mulch \n  \n  Victoria\u2019s environment watchdog is holding a press conference after asbestos was discovered in mulch at several parks in Melbourne earlier this month. \n  The Victorian Environment Protection Authority on Sunday said it had ordered Hobsons Bay city council, in Melbourne\u2019s west, to hand over records and conduct wider testing for asbestos after the material was found in several reserves in the council area. \n  The EPA\u2019s director of regulatory services, Duncan Pendrigh, says the watchdog\u2019s inspections uncovered contaminated material at six parks, including five in the Hobsons Bay council region. \n   \n   We\u2019ve found the contamination in those parks is very low. We\u2019ve only found a handful of asbestos piece through combing through a number of parks in the council area. We can provide assurance to the public that the risk of harm from the contamination is very low. \n   \n  Pendrigh says council has fenced off the sites as a precaution. He says it\u2019s unlikely that mulch producers are the source of the asbestos given past widespread testing by the regulator. \n  Pendrigh says the EPA is still investigating the possibility of illegal dumping, noting there has been an uptick in this in recent months. \n  \n Updated at 2.43am BST \n \n \n  2.36am BST  \n  \n  Littleproud: government acted too slowly to address supermarket duopoly \n  The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has accused the government of acting too slowly to address Australia\u2019s supermarket duopoly following the release of an interim review of the grocery code. \n  Speaking to reporters from his south-west Queensland electorate of Maranoa, Littleproud welcomed the report\u2019s recommendations but said they had come too late and should have included powers to break up major supermarkets. \n  \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute disgrace that we\u2019ve now taken 15 months for this government to get a report and we\u2019ll still wait another two months before they get a final report from Dr Emerson to implement anything,\u201d he told reporters in Warwick, a town two hours west of Brisbane. \n   \n   [Major supermarkets control] 74% of the grocery market in this country. In the UK and the US, the big three supermarkets in those respective countries control between 30 to 40% of the grocery market. \n   So this market concentration needs competition \u2026 we need to increase the opportunity to bring new players in. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.40am BST \n \n \n  2.32am BST  \n  \n  Chalmers and Leigh weigh in on divestiture powers \n  Jim Chalmers is now taking questions from reporters, and is asked whether he is \u201cdeadset against divestiture\u201d if that idea comes before the parliament? \n  He responded: \n   \n   I think the prime minister has made clear the government\u2019s view when it comes to that and I think others \u2013 whether it is Craig Emerson today, whether it is the chair of the ACCC \u2013 it\u2019s clear to us that there are much higher priorities when it comes to competition policy.  \n   That\u2019s not something we\u2019ve been exploring because we have found better, more effective ways to deal with some of the issues in our competition policy landscape. \n   \n  Andrew Leigh also weighed in and said the Harper review, Hilmer review, Dawson review and now the Emerson review each did not recommend divestiture powers. \n   \n   The National Farmers Federation have opposed divestiture powers, the ACTU has also been quite clear that they have concerns about it because of the potential impact on workers. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.38am BST \n \n \n  2.27am BST  \n  \n  Consumer group Choice\u2019s first quarterly price monitoring report to come end of June, Andrew Leigh says \n  The assistant minister for competition, Andrew Leigh, was next to address the media. \n  Speaking on the interim supermarket report, he said the government has \u201cfrequently\u201d heard concerns from suppliers about making complaints under the existing voluntary code because of \u201cfear of retribution\u201d \u2013 which is why Emerson has recommended a mandatory code. \n  Leigh said this sits alongside work he and Chalmers have been doing to make the economy more competitive overall. \n   \n   The treasurer and I announced the competition taskforce last year which has been working on the issue of mergers \u2026 the issue of non- competes \u2026 and improving competition in data and digital. \n   We\u2019re revitalising national competition policy, inspired by the work done in the early 1990s under Fred Hilmer and Paul Keating which put $5,000 a year into the pockets of a typical Australian household. We understand many of these challenges involve working with states and territories and we are actively engaged in that. \n   In the supermarket space, the treasurer has tasked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to do a deep dive inquiry into grocery store competition and making sure consumers are getting the best deal possible. Choice are now out collecting the data for the quarterly price monitoring report, the first of which will be coming the end of June. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.37am BST \n \n \n  2.22am BST  \n Treasurer to announce \u2018substantial changes to the mergers regime\u2019 later this week \n  \n  The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is speaking to the media in Canberra about the interim supermarkets report from Craig Emerson. \n  If you missed it earlier, Daniel Hurst has all the details: \n   \n    Related: Australia\u2019s big supermarkets could face penalties of up to $10m under proposed mandatory code  \n   \n  Chalmers said he would announce \u201cvery substantial changes to the mergers regime\u201d later this week. \n   \n   The changes I announce this week will be all about strengthening and streamlining the mergers regime so we can modernise it and make our economy genuinely more competitive, productive and dynamic in the interests of all the Australian people, employers, employees alike. \n   \n  Speaking on the interim report on supermarkets, he said would help \u201cstrengthen the food and grocery code for the better\u201d, ensuring a \u201cfair go\u201d for farmers and consumers. \n   \n   It recognises by replacing a voluntary code with a mandatory code that it is easier to enforce and we can impose penalties on people who do the wrong thing, and it is also harder for people to walk away from. \n   \n  Responding to criticism from the Nationals that something should have been done sooner, Chalmers said: \u201cIf David Littleproud thinks more should have been done in this area sooner, where were they for the almost decade that they were in office?\u201d \n  \n Updated at 2.36am BST \n \n \n  2.00am BST  \n Anne Twomey: \u2018I honestly don\u2019t see why lobbyists do need to be sponsored for a pass\u2019 \n  \n  Continued from last post: \n  Labor senator Louise Pratt asked Anne Twomey whether publishing details of which politicians sponsored certain lobbyists could make inferences about their motivations. \n  Twomey said: \n   \n   If you don\u2019t want an inference of your relationship with a particular lobbyist then don\u2019t sponsor them for a pass. That\u2019s really a choice \u2026 \n   I honestly don\u2019t see why lobbyists do need to be sponsored for a pass. I mean, the reality is, if you\u2019re the minister for whatever, you could have formal meetings with people who make an appointment to meet you and they get a temporary escorted visitor pass \u2013 you\u2019ve got staff in your office that can escort them from the public area to your office and there\u2019s really no problem with that so I\u2019m less concerned about people drawing inferences from who members of parliament sponsor for a pass because no one\u2019s forcing you to sponsor them for a pass. \n   \n  Twomey and Yee-Fui Ng have both called for better regulation of the register, which is currently being overseen by the attorney-general\u2019s department. \n  \n Updated at 2.27am BST \n \n \n  1.58am BST  \n  \n  First hearing of parliamentary inquiry into lobbying kicks off \n  Lobbyists working in Parliament House are in the spotlight today as a federal parliamentary inquiry takes a look at whether the rules and regulations applying to them are still fit for purpose. \n  The esteemed constitutional lawyer Anne Twomey appeared this morning along with associate professor Yee-Fui Ng, an accountability expert, who both acknowledged that lobbying was important for informing politicians about issues in the country but warning regulations were \u201cvery weak\u201d. \n  Both experts say the lobbying register, which publicly names those lobbying politicians and holds them to a code of conduct, should be expanded to include in-house lobbyists \u2013 sometimes referred to as government relations. \n  Ng said it meant the register provided an \u201cincomplete picture\u201d, estimating that only one in five lobbyists are actually being captured by it. \n  There was also discussion about who can access Parliament House unaccompanied. Right now, there are around 2,000 people with \u201corange\u201d passes, meaning they can access Parliament House at any time unaccompanied once sponsored by a senator or MP.

Israel has been saying it hasn\u2019t been violating international law, and that flies in the face of all available evidence from day one. \n   \n  Even if the airstrikes were not a deliberate attack on civilians, Saul said it could still constitute a war crime if Israel\u2019s offensive caused excessive civilian casualties relative to military advantage, or if the state launched strikes that failed to differentiate between targets and civilians. \n   \n   Every state has an obligation to respect its international humanitarian law obligations. \n   \n  - from AAP \n  \n Updated at 1.22am BST \n \n \n  1.04am BST  \n  \n  Nationals back fines for supermarkets in Emerson report \n  The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, was on ABC News just earlier to discuss the interim supermarket report from Craig Emerson: \n   \n    Related: Australia\u2019s big supermarkets could face penalties of up to $10m under proposed mandatory code  \n   \n  He welcomed the move for supermarkets to face big fines under a mandatory code of conduct, and said the Nationals had proposed this 18 months ago. \n   \n   I think the arbitration piece is very important as well, because of the fear of retribution. The architecture needs to be worked on closely \u2026  \n   We do believe we need to work closely and look more seriously at things like land banking, that does take away competition \u2026 \n   \n  Littleproud was also asked about calls for forced divestiture \u2013 which was not recommended in the report. Earlier, Emerson said divestiture could result in supermarkets selling to other large competitors, decreasing competition, and leaving only foreign buyers. \n  Littleproud said there were already foreign investors in the market, pointing to Aldi and Costco: \n   \n   If you can increase the number of players, that increases the competition, but there needs to be guardrails that are trigger points to understand [how] that can be achieved. Not necessarily saying those small players can\u2019t deliver the same outcomes as Woolworths or Coles or Aldi can \u2026 that\u2019s where we need to make sure we understand in this country there\u2019s a concentration of market power.

Two-thirds of university staff are employed insecurely.NTEU national president, Dr Alison Barnes, said the case highlighted the need for major changes to all Australian universities: \n   \n   A $75,000 fine is welcome, but shocking incidents like this will keep happening unless there\u2019s major changes to universities\u2019 broken governance model. \n   \n  In submissions to the court, the university apologised for its contraventions and acknowledged the need to improve. \n  \n Updated at 1.08am BST \n \n \n  12.45am BST  \n Qantas adds 20 million rewards seats in sweeping frequent flyer revamp \n  \n  Qantas has unveiled sweeping changes to its frequent flyer loyalty program, boosting access to rewards seats and introducing varying pricing. \n  Under its new Classic Plus rewards scheme, members will have access to 20 million more rewards seats, the cost of which will vary in line with flight demand. \n  During peak periods, customers will use more points to pay for their seats on both domestic and international flights than during off-peak, better value periods. The changes take effect from 1 July on international flights and later in the year for domestic flights. \n  The Qantas CEO, Vanessa Hudson, said the change was one of the biggest expansions the carrier had made to the frequent flyer program in its 35-year history: \n   \n   We\u2019ve spent a lot of time listening to members about how we can better reward them. \n   \n  Qantas Loyalty CEO, Andrew Glance, added that the new type of reward seat would usually require more points than those needed to book 5 million existing Classic rewards seats across Qantas, Jetstar and 45 partner airlines, with no change to the points required to book those seats. \n  \n Updated at 12.59am BST \n \n \n  12.36am BST  \n  \n  Pocock calls for \u2018transparency and accountability\u2019 ahead of lobbying inquiry \n  Senator David Pocock has also been leading calls for lobbying reform.

I\u2019m hoping this inquiry shines a light on that and comes up with a set of robust recommendations for reform. \n   \n  Pocock said strong evidence was being presented to the inquiry about \u201cthe need to ensure there is a public register of the lobbyists who have passes and who also who gave them that access\u201d: \n   \n   Politicians have given more than 2,144 people unfettered all-hours, all-areas access to Parliament House, but we don\u2019t know who those people are.  \n   I believe if you\u2019re not willing to own up publicly to either having a sponsored pass or giving someone one, then maybe you shouldn\u2019t have one. \n   \n  The committee is due to report on 30 April this year. \n  \n Updated at 12.41am BST \n \n \n  12.29am BST  \n  \n  Senate inquiry into lobbying to hold public hearings today \n  A Senate inquiry into lobbying is holding its public hearings today. \n  The teal MP and independent member for Kooyong, Monique Ryan, introduced a private member\u2019s bill in November to enforce stronger rules and more transparency around lobbying. \n  She said there had been \u201coverwhelming\u201d support for the proposed measures, with more than 100 submissions made to the inquiry.

And we also want full accountability for these deaths. \n   Now, the information Israel has provided so far on the investigation hasn\u2019t yet satisfied our expectations.

What do you do? Tell Coles to sell to Woolworths \u2013 that would lead to an increased concentration of market power as well. Or do you somehow get a foreign company to come in and have presence in a regional town? \n   It is a reflection of the need to have serious responses to what is a serious problem rather than a populist response. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.32pm BST \n \n \n  11.14pm BST  \n  \n  PM \u2018absolutely\u2019 confident supermarket review will reduce prices for consumers \n  The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking to ABC News Radio, also weighing in on Craig Emerson\u2019s supermarket review. \n  Albanese has said transparency is needed because there is a gap where \u201cprices have fallen for farmers [but in some instances] prices continue to increase for consumers at the checkout\u201d. \n  The PM said he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d confident the review would reduce prices for consumers: \n   \n   Including the Senate review \u2026 we\u2019ve already announced our funding of Choice, the consumer organisation, to do quarterly price monitoring, ensuring that consumers know where the best deal is available and using that use of information to drive that competition through the system. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.24pm BST \n \n \n  11.05pm BST  \n  \n  Minns backs heavy fines for supermarkets \n  The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, has been making the rounds on breakfast television, and discussed Craig Emerson\u2019s review into supermarkets while on the Today show a bit earlier. \n  Asked about the recommendation that supermarket giants be hit with heavy fines rather than be split up, Minns said it \u201ccan\u2019t hurt\u201d. \n   \n   We\u2019ve only got a few supermarkets in Australia and it does concentrate a lot of market power in the hands of the retailers, [so] heavy fines might be the way to go. I certainly wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of that.  \n   And I know many people, particularly in one of the richest cities in the world in Sydney, are doing it incredibly tough when you\u2019ve got the dual hits of both interest rate rises and high inflation. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.14pm BST \n \n \n  10.59pm BST  \n  \n  Why has Craig Emerson not recommended laws around supermarket divestiture? \n  He told ABC RN that supermarket divestiture was a \u201cpopulist idea\u201d and questioned who the stores could be sold to: \n   \n   Let\u2019s say it\u2019s Coles who gets hit by a forced divestiture. Are they going to sell to Woolworths? What does that do for market concentration? \n   And if they say \u2018well, no, you can\u2019t sell to Woolworths because that will increase market concentration\u2019, who do they sell to? Oh, well maybe a foreign multinational, but they don\u2019t want to come here. And so the only options then left [are to start] closing stores, which would terrify their workers [and close local stores for customers], so I just can\u2019t see the sense of it at all. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.31pm BST \n \n \n  10.54pm BST  \n  \n  Systematised supermarket misconduct could attract penalties of 10% of annual turnover: Emerson \n  ABC RN host Sally Sara: What kind of penalties or fines would be in place if the big supermarkets are not toeing the line? \n  Craig Emerson: \n   \n   If they do it in a very egregious, systemic way? That could be massive, like $10m, or even 10% of the annual turnover of a supermarket in the preceding court months \u2013 now that runs into the billions \u2026 \n   \n  Emerson defined this conduct as supermarkets telling their buyers to \u201cscrew\u201d suppliers, break contracts with them, de-list them and \u201cbrutalise them in order for [the supermarket] to maximise [its] profit\u201d. \n   \n   Now, you would hope and expect that sort of behaviour won\u2019t happen, but just having the watchdog \u2026 on the front porch and off the leash \u2026 is designed to focus the attention of the supermarket management so that they know exactly what their buyers are doing and don\u2019t condone it and don\u2019t try to incentivise it. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.09pm BST \n \n \n  10.49pm BST  \n  \n  Emerson outlines interim report on supermarkets \n  The former Labor trade minister Craig Emerson was on ABC RN earlier this morning to discuss his interim report on the supermarket giants, which has recommended a mandatory code of conduct. \n  Daniel Hurst has all the details on this below: \n   \n    Related: Australia\u2019s big supermarkets could face penalties of up to $10m under proposed mandatory code  \n   \n  Emerson said his inquiry has been examining the relationship between supermarkets and their suppliers, and he\u2019s found that if suppliers get a better deal, this does not necessarily mean prices will go up: \n   \n   Because if the suppliers are really, you know, operating on survival mode, they\u2019re not going to have the money to invest to upgrade their facilities, provide [better] products at a lower price. So this actually fits into the cost-of-living issue quite well, and what I\u2019m trying to do here is have the best of both worlds. \n   And by that I mean yes, have ACCC watchdog enforcement through a mandatory code, but also keep some of the provisions of the existing voluntary code where people are encouraged to sort things out amicably through mediation, but ultimately, if necessary, through arbitration. \n   I\u2019m asking the supermarkets to accept arbitration and the outcome of arbitration \u2013 interestingly, under the constitution, that can\u2019t be required by a government or the ACCC \u2013 so I\u2019m asking them to sign up to that. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.01pm BST \n \n \n  10.40pm BST  \n  \n  NSW premier discusses flood situation, recovery and preparedness \n  The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, said 30 homes had been inundated during the floods in Sydney and surrounds. \n  Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, he said about 800 people had been evacuated from their homes, or were under an evacuation order \u2013 from 300 homes. \n   \n   Obviously that\u2019s devastating for those families [who have been inundated]. But it could\u2019ve been a lot worse. We\u2019re very grateful for the SES and emergency services across the state who kept us safe during a difficult period. \n   \n  Minns said the state government would \u201ccome down hard on\u201d any insurance companies found to be \u201cdragging their feet\u201d. \n   \n   There\u2019s no easy answers. We have committed $200m for evacuation routes and local levies. That\u2019s part of a half-a-billion package we want to spend in the next 10 years. We\u2019ve taken a decision to not allow homes to be built in flood-prone land in Sydney\u2019s west. It was a controversial decision, but it\u2019s about managing a difficult situation.

As water levels began to recede, about 800 people in the Sydney region were still affected by evacuation warnings. \n  NSW State Emergency Service assistant commissioner Dean Storey said it was likely these evacuation warnings would be in place over the next few days: \n   \n   It is our priority to get people back to their homes as soon as it is safe to do so. Once the flood water recedes our crews will be out in force on the ground assisting with damage assessments. \n   \n  So far in the Illawarra region 57 properties have been found to be damaged, 28 inundated with flood water and 14 deemed non-habitable. \n  Residents have been warned that the effects of the weekend\u2019s record-breaking rain could still present danger in the region, with damage to roads and train lines.

Pillar 2 covers collaboration on technologies such as hypersonic weapons and artificial intelligence, but not the high-profile project for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. \n  The Financial Times reported over the weekend that the Aukus defence ministers would announce talks on Monday. The paper reported that Australia and the UK had, for months, been pushing back at the idea of inviting Japan into the pact too soon, as they wanted to first iron out existing practical issues. \n  When asked for comment, a spokesperson for the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said any engagement of additional countries in Aukus projects would be \u201ctrilaterally decided and announced\u201d. The spokesperson said: \n   \n   The deputy prime minister has said publicly, and to Japan, that we will seek opportunities to engage close partners in Aukus pillar 2 as our work on critical defence and security capabilities progresses.

Higgins has told the federal court the suggestion by an AFP officer that she might have been drugged should have been raised in the defamation trial. \n   The Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) in Hobart has been ordered \u201cto cease refusing entry to the exhibit known as Ladies Lounge \u2026 by persons who do not identify as ladies\u201d after a legal battle.

Auerbach said he got the document from Lehrmann. \n  An AFP note in the document - which was a master chronology prepared by Lehrmann\u2019s lawyers - said: \u201cI also have concerns from info I heard that this may have happened before or could happen again.

Women who enter the space are pampered by male butlers and served champagne while being surrounded by some of the museum\u2019s finest pieces of art. Those who do not identify as women are not permitted entry. \n  Lau had argued that denying men access to some of the museum\u2019s most important works (there is a Sidney Nolan, a Pablo Picasso and a trove of antiquities from Mesopotamia, Central America and Africa in the women-only space) is discriminatory. Kaechele said that was the point. \n   \n    \n    The artist Kirsha Kaechele leaves a hearing at the Tasmanian civil and administrative tribunal on 19 March.

All credit to Eva Lawler, she has been very strong about these decisions and I know that they have not been popular decisions. \n   She has done this in the interest of the community, of the town, for businesses but also, more importantly, for the young ones that are on the street. \n   \n  Scrymgour says action needs to be taken to reduce the number of liquor licenses in the community, as well as introducing more temporary housing for young people, where they can be connected to services. \n  The Labor MP said that the curfew and the incidents that prompted it have made people realise that \u201cthe status quo cannot continue\u201d. \n  \u201cPeople want to do something about this and I think it has taken last week\u2019s riots, the tragic death of the young person, to finally resonate with people that we cannot continue,\u201d she said. \n  \n Updated at 8.15am BST \n \n \n  7.15am BST  \n Mayfair 101\u2019s James Mawhinney charged after Asic investigation \n  \n  The high-profile fund manager behind failed plans to redevelop Queensland\u2019s Dunk Island has been arrested and charged with four counts of engaging in dishonest conduct, the corporate regulator says.James Mawhinney faced the Melbourne magistrates court on Tuesday and was granted conditional bail including that he remain in Australia. He did not enter a plea. It is understood the businessman behind the collapsed private investment fund Mayfair 101 had recently returned to Melbourne for a retrial of civil proceedings brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) in the federal court.The federal court initially hit Mawhinney with a $30m fine and a 20-year ban on offering financial products for misleading and deceptive conduct.The court has heard that investors \u2013 including retirees who were sold the products as alternatives to term deposits, a former Nationals MP and Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation political party \u2013 stood to lose a combined $211m raised by companies run by Mawhinney since 2016.Mawhinney successfully appealed his sanctions in 2022 on the grounds he was not granted procedural fairness, and a retrial was ordered. Those proceedings began on Monday.The Australian reported the fresh charges relate to an unregistered investment scheme, IPO Wealth.According to ASIC: \n   \n   It is alleged that on four occasions between 9 August 2019 and 21 April 2020, Mr Mawhinney dishonestly misrepresented to the trustee of the IPO Wealth Fund, that the IPO Wealth Group owned two Italian companies, Poveglia S.R.L. and Retta S.R.L, when it did not. \n   \n  Mawhinney is due to return to court on 28 June. \n  \n Updated at 7.37am BST \n \n \n  7.08am BST  \n  \n  In case you need a refresher on the Lehrmann defamation case ahead of the judgment being handed down next week, Amanda Meade, our media correspondent, spoke with deputy editor Gabrielle Jackson for an episode of Full Story.

They only delivered two new residential rehabilitation beds in the four years when they were last in government. That is half a bed a year. Drug use is a complex matter and must be dealt with sensitively and comprehensively, and we\u2019re taking the time to get it right. \n   \n  She said the government had doubled funding in the alcohol and drug treatment space since coming to government in 2014, with $372m invested in the most recent budget alone. \n  In 2020, the government tasked the former police commissioner, Ken Lay, with investigating the possible location for a facility. It was due to be finalised at the end of the year but the government asked Lay to revisit his findings after the Covid-19 pandemic. \n  The report was finally handed to the government in June 2023 but is yet to be released. Nine News Melbourne on Monday reported that Lay did not provide a suggested location for the government but highlighted three areas of the city of concern. \n  Premier Jacinta Allan and Stitt refused to confirm the report on Tuesday. \n  \n Updated at 6.41am BST \n \n \n  6.03am BST  \n  \n  Many thanks for joining me on the blog today.

Companies operating sustainable models that support workers are being forced out... Ola\u2019s exit shows how critical it is to get standards in place to lift pay and make transport gig jobs safe, secure and sustainable. \n   \n  The union said it was meeting with Ola to ensure the \u201cbest possible outcome\u201d for rideshare drivers who will lose work after the platform\u2019s closure. \n  \n Updated at 5.54am BST \n \n \n  5.31am BST  \n  \n  Eva Lawler also went into more detail on the three recommendations not accepted by the NT government from the police review: \n   \n   The one around the transporting of prisoners [using private companies], that recommendation is one that we noted and have not accepted at the moment because we think there needs to be a lot more consideration around that \u2026 We do need to look into the possibilities of what can be done into the future but we do not think we have the resources to be able to do that right this moment. It is one that we need to spend more time on. \n   Around [private] security, we have seen an increase in private security in our shopping centres, for example, around the CBD in Darwin. It seems to work and provides reassurance also to Territorians to have security people there \u2026 We thought that the time was not right to be able to take away those of private security guards. \n   We will continue to have officers [at] our bottle shops in central Australia \u2026 We have heard loudly and clearly from Katherine and Alice Springs that they want to have a police presence or the presence of an officer. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.46am BST \n \n \n  5.25am BST  \n  \n  NT chief minister believes Alice Springs youth curfew has been a \u2018great success\u2019 \n  Eva Lawler said she had \u201canecdotal\u201d evidence of the youth curfew\u2019s success so far and is scheduled to visit Alice Springs again on Thursday \u2013 after two previous visits. \n   \n   The conversations on the ground from Alice Springs residents is that this has been the best thing that has happened to Alice Springs. It really was a circuit breaker. \n   People are feeling so much safer and more comfortable \u2026 Also the data that police have around the numbers [of kids on the street outside curfew], it started at 60 and dropped down to 40, it went up a little bit over the weekend. It is great to see those numbers have been reduced. Thirty kids on average. Maybe there is a small group continuously on the street but we are putting services around that [and] to me the curfew has been a great success. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.39am BST \n \n \n  5.20am BST  \n  \n  NT chief minister says community consultation guided curfew decisions  \n  Taking questions, chief minister Eva Lawler is asked what advice she was given in relation to extending the youth curfew in Alice Springs. \n  She said there had been a summit yesterday afternoon and she met with the commissioner this morning. \n   \n   When I made the initial decision around the curfew, as we said, we did not consult widely, we made sure we put that summit in place this week. \n   They heard from about 45 people from across Alice Springs yesterday. The overarching [view] was that we need to keep the curfew in place, particularly over the school holidays, so it will end at 6am on the Tuesday morning. \n   They will continue to monitor the curfew, like they have around the last 10 days or so, until 6am on Tuesday morning. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.45am BST \n \n \n  5.15am BST  \n  \n  NT government to accept 15 of 18 recommendations in police review \n  Speaking on the Northern Territory police review, the chief minister, Eva Lawler, said the government would accept 15 of the 18 recommendations provided. \n  The review showed the need for the organisational structure to improve, and for more support for frontline police, Lawler said: \n   \n   I\u2019m confident that we have the right commissioner and the right police minister in place to make sure that the report recommendations are implemented in full. \n   The police review provides a roadmap and clear directions about what needs to happen to get an improved and more responsive NT police force. \n   The community expects that police will have sufficient resources to be highly visible on our streets and play a greater role in preventing crime. Territorians expect a high level of service from their police force and to ensure that happens, we\u2019ll give NT police force the resources it needs to be more responsive to the needs of the community. \n   We will accept 15 out of the 18 recommendations contained in the police review. Accepting these recommendations will come at significant cost and we will see unprecedented resources provided to the NT police force. \n   \n  Lawler said the government did not accept recommendations to reduce police coverage at bottle shops in the territory, or to discontinue using private security services in public places to reduce \u201cantisocial behaviour\u201d. \n   \n   The final recommendation that is being noted, but not accepted, by government is in relation to using private companies to transport prisoners. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.43am BST \n \n \n  5.10am BST  \n Alice Springs curfew extended until end of NT school holidays \n  \n  The Northern Territory government has extended the Alice Springs youth curfew until the territory\u2019s school holidays end next Tuesday. \n  The chief minister, Eva Lawler, is speaking to the media and told reporters: \n   \n   The youth curfew will run until 6am on Tuesday, the first day back at school. The youth curfew will cover the entire school holidays. \n   We\u2019ve seen very encouraging results with introduction of the youth curfew and even after it has ended the police, the department of education, territory families and health and other service providers will keep working together much closer than they have been doing before the youth curfew. \n   We will continue to provide updates to the community on arrangements that will be put in place when the curfew ends. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.43am BST \n \n \n  5.07am BST  \n  \n  Tuning out: party ends for a third of music festivals \n  More than one-third of Australian music festivals are losing money as operational costs skyrocket, red tape becomes harder to wade through and people in their late teens and early 20s ditch events, AAP reports. \n  That\u2019s the finding from Creative Australia\u2019s first Soundcheck report, which revealed it cost an average $3.9m to run a music festival. \n  Among 51 Australian music festivals surveyed, more than half turned a profit \u2013 but 35% lost money with a median deficit of $470,000. \n  Rising operational costs were severely hurting almost half of festival organisers, while a lack of funding and grants, insurance costs and extreme weather were also sore points. \n  Australian live music venues\u2019 public liability insurance policies increased 10-fold in the year to August 2023, and one festival organiser said their insurance excess climbed from about $5,000 to $250,000. \n  The number of young adults attending music festivals slumped from 41% of all ticket buyers in 2018/19 to 27% in 2022/23. People in their mid- to late-20s overtook younger people as the biggest ticket-buying demographic. \n  Festival-goers were also waiting longer to buy tickets than they did before Covid.

But the matter was not investigated until several years later because, at the time, the ATO could not produce enough evidence to convince the AFP to investigate. \n  At a hearing into the bill today, the ATO\u2019s second commissioner, Jeremy Hirschhorn, said secrecy obligations had \u201cfrustrated\u201d the tax office\u2019s efforts in dealing with the matter, and that the proposed changes would fix that. \n   \n   These measures ... squarely address some of the frustrations which emerged through the PwC matter. The first was that when we detected this very early, we were able to tell the police, or provide some information to the police, but we weren\u2019t able, on our advice, to tell the victim of the crime being Treasury, or the potential crime, being Treasury so that first measure directly addresses that. \n   \n  Another aspect of the bill will allow the ATO to share its findings with professional disciplinary bodies, such as the Tax Practitioners Board. Hirschhorn said: \n   \n   Professionals who have participated in misconduct, in a sense, cannot cynically rely on the ATO\u2019s principled approach to secrecy for information not to get to their professional body ... the professional bodies are [so] hamstrung that they almost have to wait till there has been a finding by another government body before they can take action against members of their profession. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.55am BST \n \n \n  4.32am BST  \n  \n  Opposition congratulates new ADF appointments \n  The federal opposition has congratulated Vice Admiral David Johnston on his appointment as chief of the defence force and Air Marshal Robert Chipman on being appointed vice chief. \n  The opposition also congratulated and thanked outgoing chief General Angus Campbell for \u201chis dedication and service\u201d. \n  A joint statement from the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, the shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, and the shadow assistant defence minister, Phillip Thompson, says: \n   \n   We join with the government in thanking all outgoing leadership for their service to the ADF and the nation. \n   As Australia faces increasing challenging strategic circumstances, we need strong leaders who will ensure our ADF is well-equipped with the capabilities and personnel needed to defend our nation. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.37am BST \n \n \n  4.24am BST  \n  \n  Scott Morrison backs latest Aukus announcement \n  The former prime minister Scott Morrison has backed moves for Aukus nations to work with Japan on pillar 2 projects as part of the defence deal. \n  In a post to X, Morrison said involving other nations in pillar 2 of the deal is \u201ca natural progression\u201d and it \u201cmakes a lot of sense\u201d to start with Japan: \n   \n   Aukus was conceived and designed as a highest common denominator partnership amongst like-mindeds to extend defence tech advantage, thereby aiding stability and balance in the Indo-Pacific. Involving Japan in pillar 2 projects will complement this. \n   \n   \n   \n    An AUKUS+ framework for Pillar 2 is a natural progression. It also makes a lot of sense to start with Japan.

He told reporters today: \n   \n   Forty-five per cent of floodwaters in the Hawkesbury, Richmond catchment don\u2019t come over the top of Warragamba Dam, so we could be in a situation where we raise Warragamba, we spend $2bn and those communities are still inundated by flooding. \n   \n  But Minns said the government would look at all potential changes, including dropping the maximum allowable water level at Warragamba, as long as Sydney\u2019s drinking water supply could be supplemented. \n   \n   So that\u2019s not going to give us an immediate relief, it\u2019s going to take a bit of time. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.21am BST \n \n \n  4.05am BST  \n  \n  Criminal record should not mean access to NDIS denied, says Australian Lawyers Alliance \n  The Australian Lawyers Alliance (ALA) says access to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) should not be used as a means of ongoing punishment for people who have a criminal record. \n  In a statement, it noted media reports about former prisoners and offenders accessing the NDIS. ALA spokesperson Greg Barns said any implication or message that this is somehow wrong \u201cis misplaced\u201d. \n   \n   The right to health is a human right that applies to all Australians whether they have a criminal record or not. \n   Once someone has served their sentence, they should not be further punished by denying them access to government support services, if they are eligible for them. Further, access to NDIS should be made available to people who are in prison, many of whom have serious mental and physical health disabilities. \n   In fact, while people are imprisoned and serving their sentence they are entitled to the same level of health care as others in the community. This should not change when they are released from prison. \n   \n  Barns argued the NDIS can be an important tool in rehabilitation by providing essential supports, meaning it is in the community\u2019s interest for people with past convictions to have access to it. \n  \n Updated at 4.34am BST \n \n \n  3.58am BST  \n  \n  Albanese updates gifts on parliamentary interest register \n  In other recent updates to the register, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, noted last week that he\u2019d been gifted a watch from the Sultan of Brunei, which he surrendered to his department (politicians are only allowed to keep gifts over a certain value if they pay the difference, with official gifts often surrendered to their departments). \n  He also got a bottle of wine from Brokenwood Wines, which he visited recently on a visit to the Hunter, and a \u201cminiature Boxer model from Rheinmetall\u201d after announcing a major defence industry deal with that manufacturer last week. \n  Albanese also said he had \u201cretained\u201d a custom turntable from the US president, Joe Biden, which he was presented with on his visit to America last year for a state dinner. In an earlier register update, Albanese had noted he had \u201csurrendered\u201d the turntable (which came with a \u201ccommemorative plaque\u201d), as well as surrendering books on rock and roll history, and framed AC/DC and Bruce Springsteen records. \n  \n Updated at 4.27am BST \n \n \n  3.51am BST  \n  \n  Labor MP declares \u2026 75cm statue of himself from a constituent \n  Labor MP Julian Hill has made one of the more interesting updates to the parliamentary interests register that we\u2019ve seen in a while, declaring a 75cm statue of himself that he was recently gifted by a constituent. \n  There\u2019s all manner of eye-opening updates to the register of interests from our federal politicians, from swathes of free sporting and concert tickets to envious property portfolios, and we try to keep track of some of the more interesting ones. Some MPs are meticulous in keeping up-to-date on their latest gifts and changes in circumstances, giving public notice when they\u2019re given as little as a free badge or a pack of lollies, while others are more sparing in their updates. \n  But Hill, the member for the Melbourne seat of Bruce, might have one of the more unconventional updates we\u2019ve seen in a while. \n  \u201cStatue of me received from a constituent Mr Haidary. 56cm high.

In that gathering, the RBA board only considered the case of leaving its cash rate on hold. (Mortgage holders will be hoping they start at least to consider cutting the rate at the board\u2019s next meeting on 6-7 May.) \n  Another reason why the RBA might not be that far off at least mulling rate cuts is that businesses report \u201csome modest easing in the pace of labour and materials cost growth\u201d, although both elevated, NAB said. \n  We\u2019ll get the March quarter consumer inflation figures from the ABS on 24 April. That will be widely watched - including by treasurer Jim Chalmers and Katy Gallagher as they put the final touches to the federal budget due out 14 May. \n  \n \n \n  3.35am BST  \n  \n  Tax Practitioners Board chair appears at hearing \n  The Tax Practitioners Board has appeared at a parliamentary hearing this morning about laws proposed in light of the PricewaterhouseCoopers confidentiality breach scandal. \n  The scandal came to light when a former PwC partner, who was advising the Australian government on the draft multinational tax laws, shared confidential information with his colleagues over several years, which was then sold to overseas tech companies, giving them time to prepare them for new, tougher laws. \n  The Australian Taxation Office formally referred the issue to the watchdog for tax practitioners in mid-2020, and the TPB then made inquiries with Treasury. But due to secrecy obligations, there were limitations around what information could be shared between the agencies, slowing down any inquiry into the matter. \n  The TPB, chaired by Peter de Cure, said it supported the planned legislative changes that will allow it to share protected information with Treasury about suspected misconduct or breaches of confidentiality agreements. \n   \n   I think the prior situation has been that there hasn\u2019t been enough clarity and hopefully this will give rise to improved ability to share information. \n   \n  On offering additional protections for people coming forward to blow the whistle on suspected wrongdoing, de Cure also said: \n   \n   I think it just removes that barrier and makes it clear that a person who wants to speak to us can do so with clarity of that whistleblower protection being available. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.46am BST \n \n \n  3.18am BST  \n  \n  29-year-old Adelaide woman in hospital with meningococcal disease \n  South Australian Health has alerted to a new case of meningococcal disease in Adelaide. \n  The 29-year-old woman from metropolitan Adelaide is in a stable condition in hospital after being diagnosed, the health department said. \n  SA Health has identified multiple people who have come in contact with the patient and three people have been directed to receive clearance antibiotics. \n  There have been nine cases of meningococcal in South Australia total so far this year, up from 5 this time last year. \n   \n   \n    HEALTH ALERT: Meningococcal case - 9 April 2024 pic.twitter.com/A89eIHyGcb\u2014 SA Health (@SAHealth) April 9, 2024\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  3.07am BST  \n  \n  Ola rideshare app appears to close operations in Australia \n  Rideshare app Ola appears to have abruptly closed its operations across Australia. \n  It has sent an email out to customers stating its \u201cservices will no longer be available in your area\u201d from 12 April. \n  We have viewed emails sent to customers in Canberra and Queensland, alerting it would \u201cdiscontinue operations\u201d.

It found that permanent serving and former members were at greatest risk, being almost six times more likely to have such contact than reservists. \n  In a statement, the royal commission said the research estimated that the death rate for male veterans who had experienced suicidal ideation was almost eight times that of the general male Queensland population and, among female veterans compared with the wider female population, the rate was 10 times greater. \n  The royal commission\u2019s chair, Nick Kaldas, said the findings challenged Defence\u2019s argument that service protects against the risk of contemplating suicide. Kaldas said in a statement: \n   \n   For some time, there was a reluctance to accept that issues of suicide and suicidality were impacting current serving members. This research demonstrates there is a clear link between service in the ADF and suicide and suicidality, which was accepted for the first time by military chiefs at our recent Sydney hearing. \n   \n  The commission completed its public hearings recently but is still taking evidence in private session ahead of publishing its final report later this year. \n   \n   Lifeline: 13 11 14 \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.26am BST \n \n \n  1.54am BST  \n Landmark Tickle v.

He told reporters earlier this morning: \n   \n   We welcome more transparency, more accountability for what is a tragic occurrence, there have been almost 200 aid workers [who] have lost their life during this conflict. \n   No aid worker should be at risk of losing their life when they are providing support in a humanitarian way. \n   Quite clearly, in Gaza, there are dire consequences for the population there. Issues of access to clean water, access to food, basic provisions, people suffering greatly. We want to make sure that that humanitarian support is available there. \n   \n  The PM also said he had spoken with Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on concerns about a potential ground invasion of Gaza. \n   \n   We\u2019re very concerned about the humanitarian consequences as are like-minded countries, including the United States. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.45am BST \n \n \n  1.37am BST  \n  \n  Human Rights Law Centre calls for whistleblower laws to come together in single regime \n  Federal whistleblower laws should be brought together into a single regime to give those coming forward more confidence, the Human Rights Law Centre says. \n  The legal advocacy group is appearing at a parliamentary inquiry this morning and has warned there are three different whistleblowing protection laws \u2013 for those in the public sector, private sector and for those blowing the whistle on issues within tax administration. \n  The committee is looking at proposed amendments to tax laws to close loopholes that allowed the PricewaterhouseCooper confidentiality scandal to occur, and to strengthen disclosure protections to encourage whistleblowers to come forward with wrongdoing in the taxation space. \n  Jade Tyrell, the law centre\u2019s acting senior lawyer, said whistleblowers were often the only reason these scandals came to light and therefore it was essential to protect them. By bringing together the three different protection regimes, the pathway for disclosures could be made simpler. \n  Tyrell said: \n   \n   Research has shown that whistleblowers are the primary mechanism for identifying wrongdoing about organisations. Robust, accessible protections are essential to prevent future PwC leak-equivalents. Whistleblowers make Australia a better place. \n   \n  Kieran Pender, HRLC\u2019s acting legal director, said the bill in its current form goes a step forward in the right direction but needs to address how to support whistleblowers after they\u2019ve come forward. \n  \n Updated at 1.39am BST \n \n \n  1.31am BST  \n  \n  Burning rubbish found on Sydney road likely contains asbestos \n  Burning rubbish suspected of being contaminated with potentially deadly asbestos has been found dumped on a roadside in Sydney, AAP is reporting. \n  The pile was found about 11pm last night on a back road in Rossmore, on Sydney\u2019s south-western fringe. \n  NSW police, firefighters and the local council were involved in the cleanup of the site, which was about a 15-minute drive from two asbestos-accepting tips. \n  The discovery comes less than a week after laws doubling most pollution fines and strengthening the power of the state environmental regulator came into effect. \n  Companies guilty of wilful waste disposal that harms the environment can now be fined up to $10m, while the unlawful disposal of asbestos carries fines of up to $4m. \n  Individuals can also be fined up to $2m and $1m, respectively, for the two offences. \n  \n Updated at 1.38am BST \n \n \n  1.26am BST  \n Mid-morning summary \n  \n  If you\u2019re just joining us, here is what has been making headlines so far today: \n   \n   Australia and its Aukus partners, the US and the UK, confirmed they are considering working with Japan on Aukus pillar 2. Pillar 2 refers to advanced capability development, while pillar 1 focuses on nuclear submarines. \n   In a joint statement, the three nations said \u201csince the inception of Aukus\u201d they had always intended to work with other nations on pillar 2 projects. \n   Anthony Albanese said Japan was a \u201cnatural candidate for that to occur\u201d, and clarified this would be a project-by-project approach rather than an expansion of the membership of Aukus. \n   The opposition welcomed the announcement, but stressed the importance of ensuring nuclear submarines were delivered to Australia. \n   Vice Admiral David Johnston has been recommended to serve as new chief of the defence force from July, when General Angus Campbell will stand down. \n   The government is also recommending Air Marshal Robert Chipman serve as the AFD\u2019s new vice chief. \n   A number of other promotions within the ADF were announced. \n   Woolworths has recommended global retail giants like Amazon and Costco should be subject to the supermarket code of conduct, alongside other large Australian companies. \n   Craig Emerson, who is leading the review of the code, said that Woolworths \u201cmakes a good point\u201d. \n   A man has died following a single-vehicle crash in Sydney\u2019s lower north shore, after his car apparently lost control and hit multiple traffic lights before spinning and flipping, police say.

It was a similar story on the Upfield train line where the number of apartments jumped by 134% but there was just a 7% increase in services. \n  However, researchers did find exceptions, such as along the Frankston line where there was a 58% jump in train services but the number of apartments grew by 16%. \n  Lead researcher Steve Pemberton said the reasons for the discrepancy between areas was not clear as researchers found no pattern to explain it. He said overall, public transport services had not matched the growth of apartment housing. \n   \n   If the objective is to encourage people to live in higher density housing, then an uplift of public transport services in areas where density is increasing should be part of what helps make people want to live there. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.09am BST \n \n \n  1.01am BST  \n  \n  Richard Marles on gender equity in defence appointments \n  The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, spoke to reporters about the significance of appointing Susan Coyle to be the chief of joint capabilities. \n  Marles said: \n   \n   This time last year there had never been a woman who had served at the level of a three-star in the Australian Defence Force. As a result of this promotion round as of July this year in Michelle McGuinness, Natasha Fox and Susan Coyle there will now be three three-star rank officers in the Australian Defence Force [who are women], that\u2019s three of 10.  \n   It is a very significant step forward in terms of the participation of women in the senior leadership of the [ADF].

Subject to the governor-general\u2019s consideration and approval, the changes will take effect in July this year, Albanese said. \n  The first recommended change is for Vice Admiral David Johnston to serve as the new chief of the defence force. Albanese said: \n   \n   Vice Admiral Johnston is a proven leader, with the experience, intellect and resolve to lead the ADF in a complex and rapidly changing global strategic environment \u2026 In the Indo-Pacific, Iraq and Afghanistan, Vice Admiral Johnson has consistently distinguished himself with his capacity to ensure that different elements of defence work together. \n   His understanding of integrated defence will be critical to delivering on the priorities and recommendations of the defence strategic review, ensuring our defence force has the right capabilities and the right leadership to meet the challenges ahead. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.58am BST \n \n \n  11.29pm BST  \n Record for batteries as home energy systems top 250,000 \n  \n  There has been a 21% rise in the use of household batteries \u2013 that is, large-scale batteries that can power the home, usually charged by solar \u2013 according to Australia\u2019s annual battery market report. \n  A record 57,000 battery systems were installed in Australian homes in 2023, while a record 656 megawatt/hours of residential battery capacity came online \u2013 along with a record-breaking level of installations in businesses of 402MW/h. \n  Big batteries totalled a record 1,410MW/h of capacity installed as more states turn to energy storage to better manage the evolving electricity grid. \n  SunWiz\u2019s managing director, Warwick Johnston, released the report today and said: \n   \n   The economic value of batteries is also increasing as the gap widens between what power companies charge for electricity and what they pay for Australian home owners\u2019 excess solar energy. \n   \n  Home batteries, or home energy storage systems, soak up excess solar energy during the day to be used in the evening and overnight, particularly for charging electric cars. \n  The cumulative number of home energy storage systems installed in Australia has topped 250,000, totalling 2,770MW/h, SunWiz said. \n  At grid-scale and with homes and businesses combined, almost 6,000MW/h of battery storage has been installed since 2015, the report found. \n  - from AAP \n  \n Updated at 11.35pm BST \n \n \n  11.25pm BST  \n Search to resume this morning for missing bushwalker \n  \n  A search will resume this morning for a woman who went missing while bushwalking at Belmore Falls in New South Wales. \n  Just after 1pm on Sunday, emergency services were called to Belmore Falls near Robertson after reports a woman had slipped and fallen down a cliff. An extensive search was initiated, but the 20-year-old was not located and the search was suspended at dusk. \n  The multi-agency search resumed at 8am yesterday, with police divers assisting. \n  A command post has now been established at the Belmore Falls lookout car park and the search was scheduled to resume around 8am today, police said. \n  Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. \n  \n Updated at 11.29pm BST \n \n \n  11.20pm BST  \n  \n  Nationals and Emerson agree Amazon and others should fall under supermarket code \n  Continuing from our last post with more from AAP: \n  Federal Nationals MP Bridget McKenzie said Woolworths had a point about which retailers were captured by the code. Speaking on Nine\u2019s Today show earlier, she said: \n   \n   We\u2019ve got large multinationals in the supermarket ring who aren\u2019t captured. So I\u2019d like to see this expanded over time. \n   \n  Craig Emerson agreed with McKenzie, telling the program: \n   \n   Woolworths, I think, makes a good point, and that is the code to be extended should be expanded to cover rivals Amazon, Costco and even Chemist Warehouse. \n   \n  But ultimately, the Nationals and the Liberals wanted to see divestiture powers in competition laws in the future, McKenzie said: \n   \n   We\u2019ll have more to say on that in coming weeks and months. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.24pm BST \n \n \n  11.17pm BST  \n Calls for Amazon, Costco to fall under supermarket code of conduct \n  \n  Global retail behemoths Amazon and Costco should be subject to the supermarket code of conduct alongside other large Australian companies, according to grocery giant Woolworths. \n  While Woolworths is already a signatory to the voluntary code and supports making it compulsory, the company believes more retailers should be subject to its terms. A spokesperson said: \n   \n   The code should apply to all major retailers operating in Australia, including global retail giants such as Amazon and Costco, who have global revenues many times the size of Australian supermarkets. \n   \n  Hardware retailer Bunnings and pharmacy Chemist Warehouse, who compete in grocery categories like household cleaning goods and personal care, should also fall under the code, Woolworths argued. \n  The interim review into the food and grocery code of conduct recommended the guidelines be made mandatory for supermarkets with yearly revenues exceeding $5bn, and for any breaches to be met with up to $10m in fines. \n   \n    Related: Australia\u2019s big supermarkets could face penalties of up to $10m under proposed mandatory code  \n   \n  Coles, Woolworths and IGA owners Metcash all said they would consider the detail of the interim report. An Amazon spokesperson said the company was \u201cpleased to play a role in driving competition in the general retail sector to the benefit of all Australians\u201d. \n  - from AAP \n  \n Updated at 11.45pm BST \n \n \n  11.12pm BST  \n Man dies in single-vehicle crash in Sydney \n  \n  A man has died following a single-vehicle crash in Sydney\u2019s lower north shore. \n  Just after 4am, emergency services responded to reports a vehicle had crashed on Epping Road at Willoughby. \n  A statement from NSW police confirmed the driver, the sole occupant of the vehicle, died at the scene. \n  The incident caused heavy traffic along the Hills Motorway, and according to Live Traffic significant delays can still be expected hours later with heavy traffic conditions still ongoing. \n  Live Traffic says Mowbray Road is closed between Epping Road and Whitfield Avenue, with two of the three eastbound lanes closed along Epping Road. \n  Emergency services, Transport for NSW, a motorway crew and the crash investigation unit are all attending the incident. \n  Police officers have commenced an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident and a report will be prepared for the coroner, a statement said. \n  \n Updated at 11.16pm BST \n \n \n  10.59pm BST  \n  \n  Defence industry minister says Japan may collaborate on Aukus \n  The defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, has been speaking to ABC RN about the latest Aukus announcement \u2013 that Japan could potentially join the pact for pillar 2 (you can read more about this earlier in the blog). \n  He said the three Aukus nations \u2013 Australia, the US and the UK \u2013 were \u201calways interested in partnering with other countries where [it benefits the] the Aukus partners and the country in question\u201d. \n  Conroy said the three Aukus nations have \u201ca strong foundation\u201d and that Japan is at the \u201cforefront of developing cutting-edge defence capabilities\u201d. \n   \n   This is [about] collaborating on technology development on [Aukus pillar 2], on a project-by-project basis. It\u2019s not about Japan being part of the Five Eyes intelligence community, it\u2019s about technological collaboration where it makes sense for all parties involved. \n   \n  Conroy was speaking to RN from Washington, where he is meeting with key officials and defence industry leaders this week. \n  Asked about Aukus more broadly, including pillar 1 (which is the nuclear-submarine component), Conroy said it was \u201call on track and we\u2019re building steady momentum towards that\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 11.05pm BST \n \n \n  10.53pm BST  \n  \n  Craig Emerson resists guaranteeing grocery prices will fall \n  Still speaking on Sunrise, Craig Emerson was asked to give an estimate of how much prices would fall as a result of mandatory code? \n   \n   I can\u2019t give that estimate... because there is a separate inquiry being conduct by the ACCC itself into the pricing behaviour of supermarkets. So let\u2019s have that inquiry run its course\u2026 but then knit in with my inquiry, and I have been working with the ACCC all the way along with this of this. \n   \n  Q: Give Australians a ballpark [figure], what do you reckon? \n  Emerson: \n   \n   You have half of the equation, right. I am dealing with the suppliers. The ACCC will be dealing with the relationship between the supermarkets and the customers. Why would I now predict the outcome of that? That is an impossible task. Mission impossible. \n   \n  Q: Can you guarantee prices will fall? \n  Emerson: \n   \n   Well, they should fall and I don\u2019t know what is going to happen to international oil price prices, Nat. I don\u2019t know if there is going to be an expansion of the war in Ukraine. Want me to predict those too? \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.03pm BST \n \n \n  10.48pm BST  \n  \n  Craig Emerson responds to \u2018Mickey-Mouse review\u2019 criticism \n  The author behind a review of the food and grocery code of conduct has responded to comments from the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, that the interim report \u2013 released yesterday \u2013 was a \u201cMickey-Mouse review\u201d. \n  The PM has said he was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d measures in the interim report would bring down prices at the checkout \u2013 you can read all the detail on it here. Dutton argues the review was \u201cpredetermined\u201d, with the results dictated by the treasurer. Jim Chalmers. \n  Craig Emerson, who conducted the review, was on Sunrise earlier and said it was a \u201cpretty trivial position\u201d to label it a \u201cMickey-Mouse review\u201d. \n   \n   \u2026 because this voluntary code was introduced under the previous government, of which Peter Dutton was a senior minister, and it was voluntary \u2013 still is \u2013 and that is going to change. \n   But basically, there were no penalties in it. It is like saying the speed limit is 80km/hr but if you do 100km/hr that is fine. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.52pm BST \n \n \n  10.40pm BST  \n Melbourne park asbestos test results to be revealed \n  \n  Melburnians living near several parks are slated to find out whether the areas have been contaminated with asbestos, AAP reports. \n  The Environment Protection Authority is investigating after the cancer-causing substance was found at parks in the Hobsons Bay and Merri-bek council areas. \n  Inspectors have confirmed asbestos was found at the under-construction park at Hosken Reserve at North Coburg, the PJ Lynch Reserve at Altona North and the Donald McLean Reserve at Spotswood. \n  Lab results due this afternoon are expected to confirm contamination results for three others: PA Burns Reserve at Altona, GJ Hosken Reserve at Altona North and Crofts Reserve at Altona North. \n  It is unclear whether inspectors have already confirmed asbestos contamination at Shore Reserve at Pascoe Vale South. \n  Early investigations raised concerns the asbestos was being introduced to the parks through mulch deliveries, like the contaminated mulch crisis in NSW. But the regulator has said there was no evidence of that. The authority\u2019s Duncan Pendrigh said: \n   \n   Mulch producers are unlikely the source for this contamination. There may be something being introduced in the supply chain. \n   \n  The pieces of confirmed asbestos found at the Melbourne parks so far have been bonded asbestos, rather than the more dangerous friable asbestos. \n  \n Updated at 11.01pm BST \n \n \n  10.33pm BST  \n Aukus countries \u2018considering\u2019 working with Japan \n  \n  Australia and its Aukus partners, the US and the UK, have announced they are considering working with Japan on pillar 2 of the defence deal. \n  The countries released a joint statement this morning, which said: \n   \n   Since the inception of Aukus, our nations have been clear in our intent to engage others in pillar II projects as our work progresses \u2026 Recognising Japan\u2019s strengths and its close bilateral defense partnerships with all three countries we are considering cooperation with Japan on Aukus pillar II advanced capability projects. \n   \n  The lengthy statement details Aukus\u2019 progress so far and upcoming plans, across both pillar 1 (nuclear-powered submarines) and pillar 2 (advanced capability development). \n  The Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, UK secretary of state for defence, Grant Shapps, and the US secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, said that from the inception of \u200bAukus, they intended to engage with other nations on pillar 2 projects: \n   \n   Aukus partners have developed principles and models for additional partner engagement in individual Pillar II projects and will undertake consultations in 2024 with prospective partners regarding areas where they can contribute to, and benefit from, this historic work. \n   \n  The statement makes it clear this is an intent to work with Japan, not a confirmation. \n  \n Updated at 10.48pm BST \n \n \n  10.31pm BST  \n Welcome \n  \n  Good morning and happy Tuesday.
