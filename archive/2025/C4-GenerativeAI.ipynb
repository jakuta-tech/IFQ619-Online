    "[Wikipedia: Generative artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence)\n",
    "> Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI, GenAI, or GAI) is artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, videos, or other data using generative models, often in response to prompts. Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data that has similar characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "[What is GPT?](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/gpt/)\n",
    "> Generative Pre-trained Transformers, commonly known as GPT, are a family of neural network models that uses the transformer architecture and is a key advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) powering generative AI applications such as ChatGPT. GPT models give applications the ability to create human-like text and content (images, music, and more), and answer questions in a conversational manner. Organizations across industries are using GPT models and generative AI for Q&A bots, text summarization, content generation, and search.\n",
