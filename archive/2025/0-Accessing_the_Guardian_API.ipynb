<p>As the US president slapped 10% tariffs on all Australian exports, <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> and <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> have flexed their campaign muscle on how they would deal with an unpredictable American leader.</p> <p>While some within the Coalition initially welcomed the Republican’s victory in the presidential election, the associate professor at the United States Studies Centre <strong>David Smith</strong> says the opposition is now trying to avoid any association with Trump.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There were some figures who believed the Coalition could benefit from emulating Trump in some ways … but since he’s become president, he’s turned off a lot of Australians both in style and substance and the Coalition now appears to go in the opposite direction.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Australian National University international law expert <strong>Donald Rothwell</strong> says Albanese has largely tried to avoid providing a running commentary on Trump’s movements but the tariff situation has made it unavoidable on the campaign trail.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The tariffs will immediately create a contest between the government and the Coalition as to who will respond the toughest and which response will be the most effective.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

The key, he said, was that it “be in Australian hands”:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are trying to see if there is a private buyer, particularly through superannuation funds.</p> <p>The [Country Liberal party] should have never flogged it off.</p> </blockquote> <p>Albanese said the government would have “more to say” before the federal election on 3 May, but he argued Landbridge had “not had the investment into the port that’s required to bring it up to scratch”.</p> <p>“We don’t think that it is being utilised enough for Darwin,” he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Darwin has an enormous potential to be a growth area of increasing our exports through the Port of Darwin, and that is part of the context that we’re dealing with here.</p> </blockquote> <p>Albanese said a majority of ports around Australia, like airports, were owned by superannuation funds, “which means that they’re owned by the Australian people and help to make contribution to their savings”.</p> <p>Full story here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/anthony-albanese-says-chinese-lease-port-of-darwin-should-return-to-australia\">Albanese declares Chinese-controlled Port of Darwin should ‘be in Australian hands’</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-04-04T22:30:18.038Z\">at 11.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-67efd1bf8f082d3642a78268\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-04-04T21:56:21.257Z\">10.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Do Australians want their leader to cuddle up or muscle up to Trump?</strong></p> <p>Another issue for <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> is his alignment with <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> rightwing populism on matters such as immigration, defence and cutting so-called government waste.</p> <p>That was looking quite good for Dutton when the new US president took office and cut a commanding figure.</p> <p>But since then Trump’s tariffs have sparked fears of a global recession and threaten to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/asx-impact-donald-trump-tariffs-australia-stock-market\">cause a lot of damage to the Australian economy</a>.</p> <p><strong>Josh Butler</strong> reports on how Dutton, who is slipping in the polls, might deal with this problem and steer a course away from the Trump toxicity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/05/donald-trump-in-the-white-house-seemed-like-a-plus-for-peter-dutton-but-after-this-week-maybe-not-so-much\">Donald Trump in the White House seemed like a plus for Peter Dutton.

They were confident the contest would tighten and turn in their favour when voters were confronted with the “choice” of a Dutton or an Albanese government.</p> </blockquote> <p>By contrast, they say Dutton has not responded brilliantly to being questioned all the time about policies and has seemingly lost ground:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He is under pressure, though, and facing a ticking clock on questions he refuses to answer – there’s only so much longer he can promise that the gas modelling will come “soon”, that he will announce his public service cuts “at an appropriate time”. He’s getting questions on this nearly daily, and even joking that the “anticipation” of journalists will soon wear off.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, as they write, there’s a long way to go:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Albanese won the week. Even Dutton may admit that. But it’s just one week.</p> <p>“I’m not getting ahead of myself,” Albanese said. “Elections are hard to win, and there are four weeks left in this campaign.”</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/05/inside-the-australian-election-campaign-cocoon-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton\">Inside the campaign cocoon, sure-footed Albanese outboxes dour Dutton</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-04-04T22:22:24.599Z\">at 11.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-67efcf7f8f0843b305e4ac24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-04-04T21:42:15.473Z\">10.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The true size of Australia’s devastating floods</strong></p> <p>We also have a big read on the floods that have devastated western Queensland and which are now spreading to north-western NSW.</p> <p>The Bureau of Meteorology said yesterday that the flooding had “severely impacted” more catchments spanning about 1m sq km – bigger than NSW and even bigger than Texas – since heavy rain downpours began drenching south-west and central Queensland on 23 March.</p> <p>Read the full article here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/05/bigger-than-texas-the-true-size-of-australias-devastating-floods\">Bigger than Texas: the true size of Australia’s devastating floods</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-04-04T22:19:50.769Z\">at 11.19pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-67efcde18f082d3642a78225\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dan-jervis-bardy\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-04-04T21:35:26.245Z\">10.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Albanese announces furlough scheme for flood-hit workers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Flood victims in western Queensland unable to work due to the deluge will be eligible for a three-month disaster allowance after the commonwealth activated the special payment scheme. </p> <p>As the federal election enters its second week, the prime minister, <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>, will visit parts of the vast outback flood zone on Saturday to announce further support. </p> <p>The commonwealth will activate its <a href=\"https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/how-much-qld-ex-tropical-cyclone-alfred-mar-2025-disaster-recovery-allowance-you-can-get?context=80515\">disaster recovery allowance</a>, which provides payment for up to 13 weeks for workers and sole traders who lose income as a direct result of the emergency. </p> <p>The prime minister said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The vision coming out of western Queensland is truly shocking and distressing.</p> <p>My thoughts are with everyone affected by this flooding – my message to Queenslanders is we are here for you.</p> <p> My government has been working with the Queensland government to activate assistance and provide support.</p> <p> At the worst of times, we see the best of the Australian character.</p> </blockquote> <p>Applications for the allowance will open at 2pm on 8 April. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-04-04T21:47:42.451Z\">at 10.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-679b43ab8f08d7cb6f3007fa\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-04-04T21:30:52.880Z\">10.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welcome</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning and welcome to our live news blog.
