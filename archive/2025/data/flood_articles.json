{"Cameraman injured after football kick; PM visits flood-hit Queensland \u2013 as it happened [2025-04-05T05:02:53Z]": "  5.31am BST    What we learned today, Saturday 5 April    With that, we will wrap today\u2019s blog. We\u2019ll be back first thing tomorrow to bring you all the latest on the campaign trail, which will hopefully have no further injuries. Until then, here are today\u2019s major developments:  Flood victims in western Queensland unable to work due to the deluge will be eligible for a three-month disaster allowance after the commonwealth activated the special payment scheme. Anthony Albanese visited Longreach in Queensland today to meet with victims of the devastating flooding event. He said to those affected by the natural disaster that \u201cwe have your back\u201d, adding the emergency event was beyond politics. The prime minister was forced to justify his announcement of a decision to remove the Port of Darwin from Chinese ownership on ABC Radio yesterday evening, hours before the Coalition announced the policy on a visit to the city. Albanese said the Darwin Port could be subject to compulsory acquisition. While in Darwin, Peter Dutton accidentally injured a cameraman when he kicked a football with a \u201cbit too much heat on it\u201d. The cameraman is bandaged and OK.     Updated at 6.02am BST     5.08am BST       Queensland flood response is proof of value of public service, Labor says The minister for employment and workplace relations, Murray Watt, has been in Brisbane today, where he told journalists the government\u2019s response to the flooding events in western Queensland was proof of the importance of public service workers. He was aiming to contrast Labor, which has increased the number of public servants since gaining office, to the Coalition, which has pledged to slash 41,000 jobs. It is yet to disclose where those jobs will be. Watt said:  There\u2019s a view amongst some running in this election that public servants are a waste. They are not a waste at all when you think about the important work that public sector workers do, whether it be recovering from floods or anything else. I think it\u2019s absolutely incredible that we enter this election campaign with Peter Dutton and the Coalition promising to cut 41,000 public servants from right across Australia. We now know that if you break that down state by state, in Queensland alone, Peter Dutton will cut 5,500 public sector jobs from all around our state.     Updated at 5.20am BST     4.52am BST    Time to wind the clocks back    Daylight saving time ends on Sunday at 3am, when clocks move back one hour in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania. For almost 20 million Australians, the end of daylight saving means an extra hour\u2019s sleep. For others in border communities, it means clarity on opening hours and reservation times for customers between states.

The employment of 185,000 Australian Public Service workers has been in the spotlight since Peter Dutton pledged to cut 41,000 jobs and push workers to return to the office full-time if elected. The Coalition has since softened its work from home policy, with Dutton now declaring his strong support for it and pledging to further reduce the number of public servants who may be affected by return to work mandates. The Community and Public Sector Union said Dutton\u2019s comments on flexible work had caused \u201cconfusion and uncertainty\u201d as until now, it was thought all workers would be affected by full-time office requirements. National secretary Melissa Donnelly said flexible arrangements were why a record number of women worked for the federal public service and could be a deciding factor in someone working or not working.   Related: Coalition rethinks its return to work mandates      Updated at 4.32am BST     3.49am BST       Still on China, Albanese is asked whether there is any political concern over the level of Chinese ownership in food production. He says \u201cwe welcome foreign investment in Australia where it\u2019s appropriate\u201d but a port has \u201cparticular characteristics to it\u201d. But will forcing China out upset the diplomatic relationship? \u201cNo,\u201d Albanese replies.  My job is to stand up for the Australian national interest. I\u2019ll continue to do that. But I note that our relationships with China and our economic relationship has improved to the point where we have more than $20bn of exports that have returned. That\u2019s about Australian jobs and Australian interests. Most of our ports and airports are in private hands. The question is - is it in the hands of Australian national interests? One of the things about superannuation funds which own substantial assets in our ports and our airports \u2026 is that superannuation funds mean that all of you who have super accounts own those assets as well, and they get returned to Australians \u2026 there\u2019s $3tr of money available. A lot of that, at the moment, is going offshore for infrastructure investment. We want that investing here in Australian infrastructure because that produces a return for Australians as well. Thanks very much.  And so concludes the press conference.    Updated at 3.56am BST     3.46am BST       It was rather convenient of the PM to make the announcement on ABC Darwin ahead of Dutton\u2019s visit. Asked why he called the radio station last night, Albanese says \u201cwhy not?\u201d  I do lots of interviews. I called Triple M yesterday morning, and I called ... ABC Sydney yesterday.  Pressed on whether he was told an announcement was coming via a leak, Albanese says \u201cthat\u2019s up to you lot to talk amongst yourselves about what happens\u201d.  I can confirm certainly it didn\u2019t come from anyone here \u2026 We\u2019ve made an announcement, but there\u2019s more detail to come as we roll out over the next four weeks \u2026 There\u2019s nothing spontaneous about this. We have a political decision that\u2019s been made on the basis of advice \u2026 consistent with the position that we\u2019ve had since 2015, that this is an important national economic asset.  Asked if advice has changed over the past two years, he says \u201cthe government increasingly understands that we need to increase our economic resilience\u201d. Does that mean the Chinese interest in the Port of Darwin is a national security threat? Albanese says \u201cwe, as a government, have made a decision about our economic resilience, consistent with a position that I have put since 2015\u201d.    Updated at 3.48am BST     3.43am BST    Darwin Port could be subject to compulsory acquisition, says PM    There is some back and forth over a timeline on when the Port of Darwin would be removed from Chinese ownership. Landbridge has told SBS that the port is not for sale. Are you prepared to use compulsory acquisition powers? Albanese replies \u201cyes\u201d.  After how long? Why can\u2019t you say the timeframe?  \u201cI\u2019m not putting a timeframe on it,\u201d he continues.  We are a mature government that does things in an orderly way, and we\u2019ll continue to conduct ourselves in that way.     Updated at 3.47am BST     3.41am BST       The head of Landbridge told the Financial Review they hadn\u2019t heard from the government. The prime minister\u2019s earlier statement was that the government had been in contact with the company. A journalist queries this, asking who from the government had been in contact, and on what timeframe? Albanese says \u201cwe have consulted\u201d but won\u2019t go into further details as they\u2019re \u201ccommercial issues\u201d.  We have engaged with them. And individual companies have reached out about whether a sale could be got \u2026 what we\u2019re saying is that we will, if need be, compulsorily acquire.  He is then asked whether he had conversations with China before his announcement, as Peter Dutton indicated in his press conference when he said the Coalition had contacted the Chinese ambassador.  Well, he\u2019s obviously got better connections with the Chinese ambassador. That\u2019s a very strange thing for him to say. I\u2019ll just leave that sitting there. What we have done is engaged very clearly. I have made \u2013 if you go back and look at my transcripts since 2015, you will see multiple statements from me about what our position is.  So how much would it cost taxpayers? Albanese says it\u2019s a commercial position and he won\u2019t engage in speculation.    Updated at 5.02am BST     3.38am BST       PM coy over timing for Darwin returning to Australian ownership OK, but why didn\u2019t he first act upon it when elected more than two years ago? Albanese says the government established an inquiry after taking office and had been \u201cengaging\u201d with stakeholders. He says any time he has been asked about the matter since 2015, he has given the same answer. Asked if Labor could \u201cbeat or match\u201d Peter Dutton\u2019s commitment for the port to be returned to Australia in six months, Albanese says that\u2019s just \u201ctalking on the run\u201d.  I have seen his media release and his media release pretends this has nothing to do with the commonwealth government of which he was a cabinet minister. And then he was the defence minister during this time as well. He did absolutely nothing. What my government did was have an assessment of these issues but, at the same time, we didn\u2019t wait for that. We looked for interest, including through superannuation funds. I want this to go into Australian ownership. But I\u2019d prefer it to be Australian ownership under the private sector. But, if need be, we will purchase as well.  Pressed \u201cby when\u201d, he doesn\u2019t answer.    Updated at 3.41am BST     3.35am BST       On to the Port of Darwin developments, which Albanese was quick to make on ABC Radio yesterday ahead of the Coalition\u2019s formal announcement to bring it back into Australian hands during a press conference this morning.  Why has it taken an election to make some announcements about this?  Albanese says \u201cit hasn\u2019t\u201d, adding Labor opposed to sale when it was made to the Chinese government under the Coalition in 2015.  That was a direct result of the program introduced by the Abbott government in its 2014 budget of asset recycling, which provided an incentive for state and territory governments to flog off our infrastructure assets. In this case, in April of 2016, the commonwealth gave the Northern Territory government of the Country Liberal party - $19.5m. A cash bonus for flogging off the Port of Darwin. When we\u2019ve come to office, we have been engaging \u2013 including with Landbridge \u2013 with superannuation funds. The Northern Territory government have been in consultation with my departments as well in our government. We\u2019ve had Treasury and Finance looking at this as well. And I foreshadowed on Thursday, as you are aware, a future announcement about the Port of Darwin. We have a clear view, which is that it should be in Australian hands. And Peter Dutton was in the cabinet that sold it.     Updated at 3.37am BST     3.33am BST       Asked if he would be open to extending the disaster payments beyond 13 weeks, Albanese says that is the \u201callowance\u201d under the existing fund.  That is the standard, that is not a new fund, that is something that happens in terms of disaster-relief. We will continue to engage constructively with the Queensland government and local mayors \u2026 We will continue to listen to them on the ground as well.  He says it \u201ctakes time\u201d for regional infrastructure funding to be rolled out, adding the electorate of Maranoa where he is appearing received the most projects in funding announced in January this year.  What we have done is make sure that we have been responsible. I remind you that we turned a $78bn deficit into a$22bn Labor surplus. We then turned the next year a deficit that was projected to be over $50bn- we turned that into a surplus in excess of $15bn. And this year, we have almost halved the deficit that was anticipated. So we have been responsible. We\u2019ve improved the budget bottom line by some $207bn. The first government to produce two budget surpluses in a row in two decades.     Updated at 3.35am BST     3.30am BST       Albanese points to the \u201cunprecedented impacts\u201d of flooding across the region.  What role do you think climate change is playing, if any, in exacerbating those impacts?  He replies that you can\u2019t say any single extreme weather event is solely related to climate change, but science indicates they will become more frequent and more intense.  You cannot say any extreme weather event any single event is just because of climate change. What you can do is look at the science and what the science has told us is that there will be more extreme weather events, more frequent and more intense. That is what we have seen play out, not just here in Australia but around the world.     Updated at 3.33am BST     3.28am BST       On to questions. The prime minister is asked rather bluntly by a reporter \u201cwhy are you here?\u201d, given the electorate is the safest Coalition seat in the country. He replies he wants to be the prime minister \u201cof all Australians\u201d.  I find it astonishing. I read reports saying to only go to marginal seats. One of the things I think has alienates Australians to mainstream political activity is that view. These people are salt of the Earth. The people I have met today, I am so proud to be prime minister of a country that has people like these producing food and raising children like Cooper and Jacob \u2026 I want to represent the whole country. That is my job. It is not to always look at a political map.     Updated at 3.32am BST     3.24am BST       The mayor of Longreach, Tony Rayner, appears next, thanking the prime minister for his visit. He acknowledges both the federal and state government have been on the ground since \u201cday one\u201d of the flood disaster.  The announcement today of the $105m for exclusion fencing to get that back up and running will change the economic health of every town in Western Queensland. Those fences are more than just a fence around one property, they are a fence around every community in Western Queensland and what that means [is] economic safety, health and mental health.  We thank you sincerely for that \u2026 it is these partnerships with both federal and state government that keep us going.        3.21am BST       Albanese announces funding for flood-affected areas of QLD Albanese formally announces he will agree to the state government\u2019s request for an additional $7m in funding. He also announces $105m from both governments for exclusion fencing.  I also want to make sure there is confidence that it is not going to run out, that it is available and it certainly will be. The other new fund we will establish today is our fine of $105m between our two governments for exclusion fencing. This is absolutely vital to protect the stock which is there with exclusion fencing coming down, from wild dogs and wild pigs potentially as well as increased fodder on the ground. We do have the Disaster Recovery Allowance also available for people who cannot work or cannot find work due to the flood.  He lists a dozen local government areas that can access the allowance.  I wish everyone well during this period. One of the things about our great Australian farmers and people on the land is this is a tough country, but they are tough and resilient people and we want to see them come through this. They make a contribution not just to their local community, but to our nation as well. We are proud and each of every one of them for the work they do contributing to our country and all of Australia stands with them at this time.     Updated at 3.42am BST     3.19am BST    Albanese to Queenslanders affected by flooding: 'we have your back'    Albanese says to those affected by the floods \u2013 \u201cwe have your back\u201d, adding the emergency event is beyond politics.  The vision coming out of all of western Queensland is indeed truly distressing and there are small communities still inaccessible that we cannot get to it this time and our thoughts are with those people who have been displaced from their homes as well \u2026 I have a message for Queenslanders which is we have your back. We are with you, we will provide whatever support necessary. Just as recently when I spent some time with the premier David Crisafulli \u2026 there were no politics, I spoke with Premier David Crisafulli yesterday and we are working hand-in-hand making sure support is provided. I also spoke today to David Littleproud. I always try to tell people when I am in their turf, I wish him well as well. He is working hard. We spoke last week in parliament about the impact of this and will continue to engage with him as the local member that has been most affected in the electorate of Maranoa where we are now.       Updated at 4.37am BST     3.17am BST       Anthony Albanese is appearing in Longreach now. He details meeting a family on a farm this morning to see firsthand the devastation that the floods occurred.  To see the power of Mother Nature in knocking over fencing and knocking over poles uprooted from the ground \u2026 you see the power of Mother Nature and the force that was there - that weight \u2026 For them to welcome us and show us around and speak to us was a great privilege \u2026 at the worst of times we see the best of the Australian character. People helping each other, the emergency services personnel, the police, Australian defence force, everyone from the Royal flying Doctor service here in Longreach, volunteers in the SES, and people around Australia who will kick in to provide support for their fellow Australians at what is a very difficult time.     Updated at 3.20am BST     3.06am BST       Reporter Jake Evans has just appeared on ABC News to describe the drop kick that injured a Channel 10 cameraman. Evans was on the scene during the incident, which occurred during a photo opportunity in Darwin.  Scott Morrison in 2022 learned the hard way when he accidentally tackled the child. Peter Dutton tried to one up that today when he punted the ball into the head of Channel 10 cameraman Ghaith Nadir, cracking a joke that \u2018there\u2019s your exclusive\u2019 before realising actually, the camera had knocked him pretty hard and knocked his forehead open. Peter Dutton was quick to check that Ghaith was OK \u2013 and he was \u2013 but a reminder for all of us that politics can be a blood sport.     Updated at 3.10am BST     2.59am BST       When politicians try to play sport \u2026 As we wait for the prime minister\u2019s press conference, let\u2019s take a moment to reflect on how playing sports usually ends terribly for political leaders. Peter Dutton\u2019s wayward football kick injuring a cameraman today joins a long history of lore. In 2022, Scott Morrison lived up to his self-applied moniker of \u201cbulldozer\u201d by crashing into a young child while playing football on the campaign trail in Tasmania. The incident was reminiscent of when Boris Johnson, then mayor of London, knocked over a child while playing rugby in Tokyo in 2015. And who could forget the former PM John Howard\u2019s infamous attempt at cricket on a trip to Pakistan in 2005, when he bowled three balls with none making it to the batsman and bouncing on the pitch repeatedly. Cricket is clearly a dangerous sport \u2013 Bob Hawke was also forced to wear an eye patch while campaigning after being hit with a perfectly delivered bouncer that the then-Labor PM failed to avoid.    And then there\u2019s Kevin Rudd, who confused Australia while PM with his handball obsession, and near-constant willingness to compete against young children. The lesson? Stick to politics.    Updated at 3.15am BST     2.49am BST       Electoral commission dealing with alleged breaches of political content laws on Rednote The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is assessing a number of complaints about alleged breaches of political content laws on the Chinese social media app Rednote, which are related to the federal election. The social media app is being embraced by candidates in electorates with significant Chinese-Australian populations, including the ultra-marginal seats of Bennelong in Sydney and Menzies in Melbourne. As reported by Guardian Australia earlier this week, some candidates are working with prominent Chinese language influencers to bypass a shadow-ban on political campaigning on Rednote, which is designed to focus on lifestyle content. The AEC has issued general guidance to candidates, stressing content shared from their accounts should contain written or spoken authorisation messages. This also applies when content is produced by a third party, such as an influencer, and then shared on their own accounts. Here\u2019s part of the AEC\u2019s statement:  The AEC assesses and, when appropriate, actions referrals made by users of the platforms. The AEC has already received a number of referrals from Australian Rednote users about electoral content for the upcoming federal election. The AEC would welcome engagement with Rednote representatives as part of our efforts towards ensuring political candidates and other relevant entities are running their campaigns according to Australian laws.     Updated at 2.53am BST     2.32am BST    Cameraman hurt by Dutton football kick with 'a bit too much heat on it'    Man down! There has been an injury on the campaign trail in Darwin, outlets are reporting. According to Andrew Tillett at the Australian Financial Review, Channel 10 camera operator Ghaith Nadir cut his head after a \u201cdrop punt\u201d by the opposition leader \u201chad a bit too much heat on it\u201d and struck the man\u2019s camera. He has been pictured bandaged up and shaking hands with Peter Dutton, who checked to make sure he was OK.       Dutton and Nadir shake hands at Cazalys Arena in Palmerston, Darwin. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP      Updated at 6.02am BST     2.11am BST       PM touches down in Longreach The prime minister has touched down in Longreach, about 1,000 km north-west of Brisbane, to visit Queenslanders affected by flooding. He headed to a sheep farm to meet Martin and Rebecca Eggerling, a couple that have been hard hit, and is expected to hold a press conference soon. On the agenda will be the extension of a three-month disaster allowance after the commonwealth activated the special payment scheme. We\u2019re also expecting Anthony Albanese to provide a little more detail on the hunt for a buyer for the Port of Darwin he announced yesterday, despite the Chinese-owned company which holds the lease insisting it is not for sale.    Updated at 2.24am BST     1.57am BST       Where\u2019s the hope? Back to Back Barries on week one of the campaign The federal election campaign was barely a week old when Donald Trump rearranged the world trading order. And in Australia, the leaders covered a lot of ground. But in a campaign lacking inspiration, where is the promise of hope? Tony Barry and Barrie Cassidy examine the impact of new tariffs on Australia just four weeks out from the election. They also debate Dutton\u2019s plan to cut public sector workers, and wonder: is it too much to ask for some big ideas? Listen here:   Related: Back to Back Barries: Trump tariffs wreak havoc on week one      Updated at 2.00am BST     1.34am BST       Independent Sophie Scamps launches re-election bid with free concert The independent MP Sophie Scamps has resurrected her 2022 \u201cElection Beats\u201d concert, with Lime Cordiale and Le Shiv set to hit the stage today in the name of democracy. The free community event on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches, expected to attract about 3,000 locals, will formally launch the re-election campaign of Scamps. She said traditional party politics \u201cdoes not work for future generations\u201d.  Millennials and Gen Zs will make up 40% of voters at this year\u2019s election, and I\u2019m hearing loud and clear they want real action on climate change, on housing affordability, an economy that works for them, and a future they can believe in. The voices of young people are being drowned out in Canberra by the same old vested interests and lobby groups. Politicians need to listen and involve young people in policy decisions, rather than simply talking at them and making decisions that will ultimately create a more unequal future for young people.  Oli Leimbach from Lime Cordiale said the band were playing the gig to \u201cencourage people to vote for Scamps\u201d.  Sure, we care a lot about live music (and so does Sophie), but we\u2019re also ocean lovers, environmentalists, and we stand for equality and integrity. That\u2019s what the Northern Beaches is all about, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re voting for Sophie.     Updated at 1.52am BST     1.21am BST       NT government backs Coalition plan to put Darwin port back in Australian hands The Northern Territory government has backed the Coalition\u2019s announcement to bring the Darwin port back into Australian hands. The acting chief minister, Gerard Maley, who appeared alongside Peter Dutton earlier, said the ball was now in Anthony Albanese\u2019s hands to detail his plans.  Prime minister Albanese has claimed he\u2019ll directly intervene but has provided no details. Territorians need certainty, not vague statements. Should Australians elect a Dutton Coalition government, we will work with them to ensure Darwin port is managed in the best interests of Territorians and the nation.  The Territory\u2019s minister for logistics and infrastructure, Bill Yan, said he had been working \u201cin good faith\u201d with the commonwealth government since late last year but \u201cwe still don\u2019t know what their plans are\u201d.  At every stage of this, the CLP have been fighting for Territorians and that will continue under a Dutton Coalition in Canberra.     Updated at 2.06am BST     1.09am BST       Have you been paying attention this week? Myself and Elias Visontay have compiled an election campaign quiz that covers all the gaffes, the gags and the plain weird. Who will win the federal election? We have no idea, but luckily that\u2019s not one of the questions. See how you fare:   Related: The great Australian election campaign quiz \u2013 week one      Updated at 1.55am BST     1.00am BST       Albanese and UK\u2019s Starmer discuss response to Trump tariffs Global fallout is continuing over the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping tariffs, including among the US\u2019s major allies. The UK has had the same 10% tariff rate as Australia imposed \u2013 the baseline rate being applied to all countries. The ABC reports Anthony Albanese discussed the global response with the UK\u2019s prime minister, Keir Starmer, and efforts to ensure trade barriers don\u2019t continue to escalate. A spokesperson for the PM said he \u201creaffirmed support for free and fair trade and the need for leaders to ensure that there was not an escalation of trade impediments\u201d, while Starmer\u2019s spokesperson said \u201can all-out trade war would be extremely damaging and is in nobody\u2019s interests\u201d.    Updated at 1.07am BST     12.48am BST       So where is Dutton heading next? He told reporters at the conclusion of his press conference that there would be a picture opportunity later on today and \u201cmaybe a petrol stop\u201d.    Dutton enthusiastically pumped the bowser during a visit to a service station in Carlingford, in Sydney\u2019s north-west, yesterday, but perhaps Darwin\u2019s servos have better lighting for pictures. He also noted the press pack had changed somewhat as we entered the second week of the campaign, telling reporters during his presser that the pace was \u201ctoo quick\u201d for some.  Welcome to the new faces \u2026 Good of you to join us here. Burnt a few others out. Pace is too quick. They\u2019ve taken a rest. Some have been subbed in. Well done.     Updated at 12.56am BST     12.39am BST       If you\u2019re wondering what exactly the Coalition\u2019s work from home policy actually means, it\u2019s understandable to be confused. The shadow finance and public service minister, Jane Hume, introduced the policy on 3 March, stating all public service workers would have to return to the office if the Coalition won government. \u201cExceptions can and will be made,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they will be made where they work for everyone.\u201d Since then, it has been walked back, with Dutton declaring it would only apply to public servants in Canberra. Now, he says \u201cflexibility continues\u201d, and has appeared to indicate existing EBAs that allow staff to work from home would still apply. So if you\u2019re a public servant outside Canberra, or you have the ability to work from home embedded in your enterprise agreement, you would be exempt, which leaves a significantly smaller pool of people to be impacted.    Updated at 12.49am BST     12.30am BST       The last question comes from Andrew Probyn, who you may recall became a TikTok sensation in 2020 when Scott Morrison said he didn\u2019t \u201crun the press conference\u201d.  I know that bashing up the public service is a bit of a political sport and has been for decades, but you have added some complexion to your work-from-home policy. You are saying that it will only affect people who work in Canberra in the public service. Two-thirds of the public service live outside of the ACT, so why is it fair for someone who works for the defence force in Perth, Mr Hastie\u2019s town, that they can work from home, but not from Canberra?  Dutton says the \u201cbulk of the public service is in Canberra\u201d, to which Probyn interjects \u201ca third of the public service\u201d. Dutton:  Under Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard, the public service, from that period until now, under this government, the way they have increased the number of public servants has increased threefold. In Canberra, there are different dynamics around travel and different dynamics in regional parts where public servants are working remotely \u2026 Flexibility continues, whether it\u2019s in Canberra or whether it\u2019s outside of Canberra, so the scare campaign that has taken place has been quite disingenuous, misleading and politically based. Our argument is we want the most efficiency for our taxpayers who are working harder than ever under this government. So, people have, I think, a reasonable expectation to know that if their taxpayer dollars are contributing to the public service, that we\u2019re delivering the public service in the most efficient way possible.  And he\u2019s off!    Updated at 12.47am BST     12.26am BST       Dutton is pointed to the fact women with children work in the public service in Canberra.  Yes, but I\u2019ve said we are very happy for flexibility in that workplace as well \u2026 we have to make sure that where we have taxpayers\u2019 money being expended on wages for public servants in Canberra that we\u2019re getting the most efficiency for taxpayers out of that investment and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s controversial. For the prime minister to be out there and Jim Chalmers and others trying to scare women in workplaces across the country, I think is a disgrace. I\u2019ve said very clearly that where you\u2019ve got existing arrangements, which happens in Canberra now in the public service, you have EBAs that are there that allow for work from home arrangements, we are not proposing to change those and that\u2019s the reality.     Updated at 12.45am BST     12.24am BST         On to other matters, Dutton is asked about YouGov polling released last night, which painted a dire picture for the Coalition\u2019s plan to force public servants to work in the office. \u201cWill you reconsider your policy?\u201d He accuses the government of \u201cscaring Australians\u201d.  Their response in relation to Medicare, to suggest that we would cut money from hospital funding or Medicare when we are in government, it is a complete lie \u2026 Why do they want to scare women when the policy doesn\u2019t affect anybody except for public servants in Canberra.  Two-thirds of public servants live outside Canberra. Dutton continues to talk about Medicare.  I think people who are listening to the Labor party lies at the moment and the scare campaign that is under way, I would say why aren\u2019t they talking about their record, if it\u2019s so good? I think that\u2019s important.  Dutton says he \u201cstrongly supports\u201d work from home and the policy has no impact on the private sector or public sector outside Canberra, and accuses the prime minister of \u201clying to Australian women\u201d.  Why he would go out there trying to deceive people, that\u2019s a question you would have to ask him. But I think it\u2019s actually pretty tardy and I think the prime minister has been caught out telling fibs a few times now and his record is starting to build up of somebody whose word I wouldn\u2019t trust on some of these issues.     Updated at 12.50am BST     12.19am BST       Dutton is asked if he looked into the ownership of the port when he was defence minister. \u201cYes,\u201d he replies.  And what conclusion did you draw?  Dutton says the advice at the time was \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a need to act\u201d.  I didn\u2019t agree with that advice, I might say, at the time, but that was the advice that the government received, and we have now found ourselves in a position where we have the advice, it is definite, the strategic circumstances have deteriorated for our country \u2026     Updated at 12.42am BST     12.17am BST       Dutton says if the Coalition needed to introduce further legislation to bring the port to a compulsory acquisition, he would.  It is absolutely essential that this port returns back into ownership that is consistent with the threat and the environment that we see ourselves in, in this century.  We need to make sure that when we\u2019ve got 100 warships passing through that port or pass that port or in the vicinity of that port on a yearly basis that we can do it in a way that doesn\u2019t raise any concerns about our national security interests and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve acted.         12.14am BST       Dutton is pointed to his recent reshuffle of cabinet, including appointing Jacinta Price in a role of government efficiency and waste. \u201cCan you ensure Australians will know what waste will be before the election or will it be like Doge (the Trump administration\u2019s own department of government efficiency)?\u201d He says it will \u201cbe like the Howard government\u201d.  That is they had a Labor mess to clean up. Have a look at what\u2019s happening in Victoria at the moment. The Labor party has almost bankrupted that economy. In Queensland it was a similar story under Annastacia Palaszczuk and Steven Miles. All you are seeing with the Albanese government is the first phase of that type of governing. They\u2019ve spent an amount of money which has driven up the cost of everything \u2026 Labor always taxes and spends, and in Victoria they are finding different ways to tax because they are running out of money. That\u2019s how Labor governs.  In other words, we do not know what the waste will be.    Updated at 12.41am BST     12.11am BST         Last month Dutton said he would prioritise a meeting with Xi Jinping just as much as Donald Trump. Is that still true? \u201cYes,\u201d he replies. Asked where today\u2019s decision puts him in that relationship, he says the trading relationship Australia has with China is important and he wants to make sure \u201cthat we expand it\u201d.  But ultimately, as China does, we have to make Australia stand up for her national interest. An Australian company wouldn\u2019t be able to operate a port in Beijing and we are saying in this time, as the prime minister points out rightly, I think, we live in the most precarious period since the end of the second world war, since 1945, and I think it\u2019s appropriate that we take the actions that meet the pressures and the concerns and the threats of the time. We can have a good trading relationship and respectful relationship with China, which is why we spoke to the ambassador ahead of the announcement that we made.     Updated at 12.52am BST     12.08am BST       Asked whether the announcement would assist with tariff negotiations with the White House, Dutton says the Coalition has been planning the policy since before Trump\u2019s inauguration.  We have announced a policy which is in our country\u2019s best interests. That\u2019s been the sole motivation here. We want to make a decision and to clean up a decision that shouldn\u2019t have been made years ago. I think what we\u2019ve demonstrated to the Australian public is that when it comes to national security, the Coalition has the runs on the board, we understand the difficult environment in which we live and we understand the response that is proportionate.  As for whether it will antagonise China, Dutton repeats it\u2019s \u201cabout standing up for our national interest\u201d.  As defence minister, as home affairs minister, I think I demonstrated every day, as well as a police officer many years ago, that I will take the decisions, sometimes hard decisions, but the decisions that will make our country safe and I\u2019ve done that over the course of my working life and it is what I want to do as our country\u2019s prime minister as well.     Updated at 12.38am BST     12.06am BST       Dutton is asked why Scott Morrison didn\u2019t make this decision when he was in power.  We are in 2025 and the circumstances have significantly deteriorated, even just in the last three years, let alone where it was 10 years ago, so we need to make sure we act in our country\u2019s best interests and that\u2019s the decision we have taken.   He says Labor had three years to \u201cdeal with this issue\u201d and they haven\u2019t.  This is a decision that is in our country\u2019s best interest. We know that we live in uncertain times and the government has had three years to deal with this issue and they haven\u2019t done that. We have taken the decision in a considered way. We will negotiate in good faith and I believe in six months we can arrive at an outcome. If that\u2019s not the case, then we will move to make sure the asset comes back into ownership arrangements that are in line with our national security needs and our national interest, and that\u2019s what we will apply.     Updated at 12.41am BST     12.04am BST       Peter Dutton is asked about how he feels to be \u201csnaked\u201d by the PM on the port announcement. He points to Anthony Albanese\u2019s radio interview on ABC Darwin yesterday evening, calling it \u201cincoherent\u201d.  Anthony should have been better prepared. He\u2019s had three years in preparation to make that phone call. It was a train wreck interview. I think, if you read the transcript, nobody was any the wiser as to what the prime minister\u2019s actually done for three years. That\u2019s the problem. The prime minister had three years to sort this out. The Landbridge operators have told us publicly, as you\u2019ve seen, there\u2019s no discussion with the government that\u2019s been under way. So I don\u2019t know who\u2019s telling the truth there \u2026 There are many other examples where the government just can\u2019t get its story right.  Dutton says the Coalition had contact with the Chinese ambassador yesterday \u201cout of respect\u201d.  I don\u2019t know whether the prime minister made a call before he called ABC radio, but we have thought through this process for a long period of time, and the prime minister jumping on the phone trying to get in on the announcement that we\u2019ve made today I think shows that this prime minister is like the fireman who turns up to the fire when the fire has been extinguished. He is too late to everything.     Updated at 12.36am BST     12.02am BST         The acting chief minister of the Northern Territory, Gerard Maley, thanks Dutton for making the announcement, incorrectly referring to him as the \u201cfederal government\u201d.  This announcement\u2019s going to give certainty to the Northern Territory. The political climate across the world has changed recently \u2026 only the Coalition government is going to do this in a way that\u2019s going to benefit Territorians.  Andrew Hastie is up next before Dutton takes questions. He says Darwin is an \u201cimportant part of Australian geography\u201d for economic and national security.  Today\u2019s announcement from Peter Dutton is critical. It\u2019s about securing our future. It\u2019s about securing our critical infrastructure. And it\u2019s about making Australia safe. Because it goes without saying we are living in dangerous and uncertain times, and we need to get Australia back on track.     Updated at 12.53am BST     11.59pm BST       Dutton points to the circumnavigating of Chinese naval ships as pressing the need for the port to be returned to Australian hands.  The intelligence briefings that I\u2019ve had over the course of my time as the leader of the opposition indicate the position has only deteriorated. We\u2019ve now seen, of course, the circumnavigating of our country by Chinese naval ships. So we need to make sure that we recognise the times in which we live and why it\u2019s important for us to take back this particular asset. There are about 100 warships a year \u2013 Australian and allied warships \u2013 which go through this area. And we need to make sure that, with our partners, we\u2019re able to work constructively and in an environment which is conducive to our national security interests.     Updated at 12.21am BST     11.57pm BST    Dutton says Coalition would 'move immediately' to remove Port of Darwin from Chinese ownership    Peter Dutton is appearing in Darwin now to officially announce an elected Coalition government would \u201cmove immediately\u201d to secure the city\u2019s Port and remove it from Chinese ownership.  I\u2019m pleased to announce today that an elected Coalition government will move immediately to secure the Darwin port and to make sure that we can bring that national asset \u2026 back into Australian ownership or into a model where we have greater assurance about the operator and the way in which the lease operates. There\u2019s been a lot of debate over this issue for a long period of time. It\u2019s clear that a mistake was made many years ago in relation to the lease and the way in which that was undertaken by the then territory government. But that is the past, and we need to deal with the strategic circumstances that we face at the moment.       Updated at 1.35am BST     11.49pm BST       Poll points to risks in key seats for Labor We\u2019ve made it to a week into the election campaign. So who\u2019s winning? According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Labor is exposed to a slump in support in Australia\u2019s two most populous states despite a political recovery in recent weeks, putting key seats at risk due to the weakness of the party\u2019s primary vote. A survey published in the outlet today shows the Labor primary vote has fallen to 30% in New South Wales and 27% in Victoria in the first three months of this year, down from 33% in each state at the last election. It\u2019s not all bad news for Labor, though. YouGov\u2019s latest Public Data poll suggests that Peter Dutton has recorded his worst-ever net satisfaction rating of -15, down from -2 in February. Labor takes a 2% lead over the Coalition with a 51% to 49% split in the two-party preferred vote. Meanwhile, the Australian Financial Review\u2019s political correspondents Tom McIlroy and Ronald Mizen say Labor came out on top in the first week.  At the end of week one, it was clear that Albanese won more days than Dutton and therefore won the week. But there are still four more to go, and anything can happen in an election.     Updated at 1.33am BST     11.38pm BST       Albanese heads to Queensland and Dutton to NT It may be Saturday, but Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton aren\u2019t letting a weekend stop them from hitting the campaign trail. The PM is heading to western Queensland to visit parts of the region battered by recent flooding. Meanwhile, Dutton is in Darwin, marking his first visit to the Northern Territory since the campaign kicked off, where both seats are now held by Labor. He\u2019s expected to detail the Coalition\u2019s announcement that it would force the sale of the Port of Darwin if elected, with a press conference to come soon. Albanese took the wind out of his sails yesterday after calling in to local Darwin radio to make a similar announcement.      Updated at 11.50pm BST     11.29pm BST       Why the Coalition is trying to avoid association with Trump There was an early belief that Donald Trump\u2019s surprise return to the White House would foreshadow a path to a Coalition election victory in Australia based on a surge in support for rightwing politics, AAP reports. But fast forward several months and local reaction to Trump\u2019s divisive policies has upended those predictions ahead of the 3 May poll. As the US president slapped 10% tariffs on all Australian exports, Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton have flexed their campaign muscle on how they would deal with an unpredictable American leader. While some within the Coalition initially welcomed the Republican\u2019s victory in the presidential election, the associate professor at the United States Studies Centre David Smith says the opposition is now trying to avoid any association with Trump.  There were some figures who believed the Coalition could benefit from emulating Trump in some ways \u2026 but since he\u2019s become president, he\u2019s turned off a lot of Australians both in style and substance and the Coalition now appears to go in the opposite direction.  The Australian National University international law expert Donald Rothwell says Albanese has largely tried to avoid providing a running commentary on Trump\u2019s movements but the tariff situation has made it unavoidable on the campaign trail.  The tariffs will immediately create a contest between the government and the Coalition as to who will respond the toughest and which response will be the most effective.     Updated at 11.43pm BST     11.19pm BST       Dry weather finally for Queensland\u2019s south-west Queensland\u2019s south-west is finally facing dry weather, giving authorities a clearer picture of the extent of the damage from flood waters. Dean Narramore, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), spoke to ABC News Breakfast this morning. He said flooding was occurring on \u201cpretty much all our rivers\u201d through the state\u2019s south-west, central and northern waterways.  That major flooding may continue for weeks, as we just saw a year or two worth of rainfall moving down the rivers there. We can see a pattern shift as we move through the coming week or two, as we see that shower and thunderstorm activity contract to far northern Australia \u2026 the rest of the country looking dry, which is great news for the flood-affected areas in Queensland but not those experiencing the drought conditions in South Australia and Victoria.     Updated at 11.49pm BST     11.09pm BST    Both parties back taking Port of Darwin out of Chinese hands    The Labor government is on the hunt for a buyer for the Port of Darwin despite the Chinese-owned company which holds the lease insisting it is not for sale. Anthony Albanese revealed the plan after calling in to local Darwin radio yesterday afternoon in a deliberate attempt to get ahead of a similar announcement the Coalition has reportedly scheduled for today. Landbridge Group took control of the port in 2015 after the Northern Territory government signed a $506m agreement while in financial duress. The deal gave Landbridge 100% operational control of the port. In 2023 before a trip to Beijing, Albanese ruled out cancelling the company\u2019s lease. But speaking with ABC Darwin yesterday, the prime minister indicated he wanted commercial negotiations to take place, and was \u201cprepared to go down the road of taxpayer direct involvement\u201d if needed.    He confirmed that two options were on the table \u2013 for the port to be privately owned by an Australian company, or return to being a government asset. The key, he said, was that it \u201cbe in Australian hands\u201d:  We are trying to see if there is a private buyer, particularly through superannuation funds. The [Country Liberal party] should have never flogged it off.  Albanese said the government would have \u201cmore to say\u201d before the federal election on 3 May, but he argued Landbridge had \u201cnot had the investment into the port that\u2019s required to bring it up to scratch\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that it is being utilised enough for Darwin,\u201d he said.  Darwin has an enormous potential to be a growth area of increasing our exports through the Port of Darwin, and that is part of the context that we\u2019re dealing with here.  Albanese said a majority of ports around Australia, like airports, were owned by superannuation funds, \u201cwhich means that they\u2019re owned by the Australian people and help to make contribution to their savings\u201d. Full story here:   Related: Albanese declares Chinese-controlled Port of Darwin should \u2018be in Australian hands\u2019      Updated at 11.30pm BST     10.56pm BST       Do Australians want their leader to cuddle up or muscle up to Trump? Another issue for Peter Dutton is his alignment with Donald Trump\u2019s rightwing populism on matters such as immigration, defence and cutting so-called government waste. That was looking quite good for Dutton when the new US president took office and cut a commanding figure. But since then Trump\u2019s tariffs have sparked fears of a global recession and threaten to cause a lot of damage to the Australian economy. Josh Butler reports on how Dutton, who is slipping in the polls, might deal with this problem and steer a course away from the Trump toxicity.   Related: Donald Trump in the White House seemed like a plus for Peter Dutton. But after this week, maybe not so much | Josh Butler      Updated at 11.24pm BST     10.48pm BST       What we learned in week one on the campaign trail As flagged in the introduction, our reporters Dan Jervis-Bardy and Josh Butler have been out on the stump all week with Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton. They have put their heads together and given an assessment of how the two campaigns have handled the first week, concluding that the Labor man has probably had the best of it fired up by his surprise tax-cutting budget and a strong message on beefing up Medicare. Albanese has looked confident, they say, and has been speaking to a message he believes voters like:  Albanese and senior Labor strategists didn\u2019t panic as the Coalition inched ahead in the opinion polls midway through 2024. They were confident the contest would tighten and turn in their favour when voters were confronted with the \u201cchoice\u201d of a Dutton or an Albanese government.  By contrast, they say Dutton has not responded brilliantly to being questioned all the time about policies and has seemingly lost ground:  He is under pressure, though, and facing a ticking clock on questions he refuses to answer \u2013 there\u2019s only so much longer he can promise that the gas modelling will come \u201csoon\u201d, that he will announce his public service cuts \u201cat an appropriate time\u201d. He\u2019s getting questions on this nearly daily, and even joking that the \u201canticipation\u201d of journalists will soon wear off.  But, as they write, there\u2019s a long way to go:  Albanese won the week. Even Dutton may admit that. But it\u2019s just one week. \u201cI\u2019m not getting ahead of myself,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cElections are hard to win, and there are four weeks left in this campaign.\u201d    Related: Inside the campaign cocoon, sure-footed Albanese outboxes dour Dutton      Updated at 11.22pm BST     10.42pm BST       The true size of Australia\u2019s devastating floods We also have a big read on the floods that have devastated western Queensland and which are now spreading to north-western NSW. The Bureau of Meteorology said yesterday that the flooding had \u201cseverely impacted\u201d more catchments spanning about 1m sq km \u2013 bigger than NSW and even bigger than Texas \u2013 since heavy rain downpours began drenching south-west and central Queensland on 23 March.

As the federal election enters its second week, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, will visit parts of the vast outback flood zone on Saturday to announce further support.  The commonwealth will activate its disaster recovery allowance, which provides payment for up to 13 weeks for workers and sole traders who lose income as a direct result of the emergency.  The prime minister said:   The vision coming out of western Queensland is truly shocking and distressing. My thoughts are with everyone affected by this flooding \u2013 my message to Queenslanders is we are here for you.  My government has been working with the Queensland government to activate assistance and provide support.  At the worst of times, we see the best of the Australian character.  Applications for the allowance will open at 2pm on 8 April.     Updated at 10.47pm BST     10.30pm BST    Welcome    Good morning and welcome to our live news blog.

People in western Queensland who have lost work because of the floods will be able to apply for a three-month disaster allowance after the commonwealth activated the special payment scheme. Applications will be open from Tuesday, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced this morning, as he said his government was \u201cworking with the Queensland government to activate assistance and provide support\u201d. More coming up. With the election campaign into ninth day today, we look back at the first week of the race. Starting with a surprise visit to Peter Dutton\u2019s Dickson electorate, our reporters travelling with the two teams think Labor leader Albanese has shown a real confidence in his message to voters that has left his opponent looking more wooden and predictable. More coming up. A big talking point today will be news that Labor and the Coalition have flagged plans to end a 99-year lease of the Port of Darwin to a Chinese company. Albanese dialled into a Darwin radio station yesterday afternoon to announce plans to find a new owner for the city\u2019s port as Coalition members were en route to the Northern Territory for an election announcement on Saturday. Dutton also backs the idea. More coming up. Dutton\u2019s enthusiasm for Donald Trump\u2019s rightwing populism is being tested now that the US president has cast doubt over Australia\u2019s military alliance with America and after he has seemingly taken a wrecking ball to the world economy. With US and European markets once again under the cosh overnight, we have been looking at how the Coalition leader can distance himself from the man in the White House. More coming up.    Updated at 10.35pm BST  ", "One Australian\u2019s dramatic rescue from a flood in one of the driest places on Earth [2025-04-01T07:49:17Z]": "Many are those rescued from Munga-Thirri-Simpson Desert \u2013 in what is normally the dust bowl of outback Queensland \u2013 who have sunk wheels in a sand dune, busted tyres upon gibber rock or even been bogged in the mud left by a sudden downpour. But Tony Woolford is among a far more exclusive club. \nIn fact, the 66-year-old South Australian may well be the first person ever plucked by helicopter in this, one of the driest places on Earth, from flood waters. \nAt least, that is according to the man who coordinated his rescue, Don Rowlands. \nA lifelong resident of Birdsville \u2013 the iconic gateway town to the Simpson \u2013 Rowlands has seen \u201cstacks\u201d of rescues in Queensland\u2019s outback south-west over his 31 years as a desert ranger. \n\u201cA lot of them having troubles now when these new fang-dangled computers throw in the towel,\u201d the 76-year-old Wangkangurru Yarluyandi elder says. \n\u201cComputers in the cars, you know, just some little thing goes wrong and you can\u2019t get them to go again. \n\u201cBut anyone rescued from floods in the desert \u2026 no, not that I can recall. \n\u201cI think this is the first you know?\u201d \nIt certainly won\u2019t be an experience Woolford will forget in a hurry. \nWhen heavy rain turned the Madigan Line track he was driving to mud, Woolford was stranded in his 4WD for five days, watching the rising flood waters come to within a metre of his refuge before he was airlifted to safety. \n\u201cI thought I would float away,\u201d he told the national broadcaster after his rescue last week. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nHad he done so, perhaps he would have ended up in Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre. \nWith vast swathes of outback Queensland inundated and many places receiving more than a year\u2019s worth of rain in a matter of days, flood waters are gradually making their way to the lowest place in Australia \u2013 that arid salt pan is set to transform into ephemeral lake. \n Interactive \n \nAs those flows pass towns and cattle and sheep stations \u2013 normally isolated by desert, plain and sheer distance \u2013 many sit as islands in a muddy sea. \nBirdsville has been cut off for more than a week, Rowlands said, and on Tuesday, the town was preparing for flood waters to rise once more as the remnants of ex-tropical cyclone Dianne wash into Queensland from the west. \nBut \u201cno one is complaining\u201d, he said. Food was being flown in weekly from Boulia, almost 400 kilometres to the north. The town\u2019s iconic pub was not going to run out of beer \u2013 they have their own plane. \nThe situation for others was more dire. At least one dad did a school run to the remote town of Jundah, in a tinnie last week. Days later, at least 25 people were airlifted from the town in helicopters as the Thomson River burst its banks. \nAdavale, about 195km further to south-east was also evacuated. \nMayor of the neighbouring Longreach shire, Tony Rayner, said his council was providing refuge for those who fled Jundah \u2013 while make their own flood preparations. \n\u201cThe situation there is really unprecedented, and we\u2019ve been helping as much as we can to receive evacuees and assist with resupply,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of water up there\u201d. \nRayner said the full effects of the flood would not be known for weeks. \nBut early estimates from the Queensland Department of Primary Industries (DPI) were already pointing to potentially devastating loss of cattle and sheep. \nThe DPI said that estimates from Monday afternoon indicated more than 140,000 livestock were missing or dead \u2013 and that figure was set to rise. \nRayner said \u201csignificant stock losses for western Queensland\u201d would \u201chave an impact on every community out here\u201d. \n\u201cNot only economically, but psychosocially \u2013 we\u2019re already getting reports of landholders that are struggling mentally with the prospect of what they know is to come,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThe trauma isn\u2019t just damage to homes and possessions \u2013 it\u2019s losing beloved animals, generations of blood lines, and in some cases faithful companions.\u201d \nA clearer picture may begin to emerge later this week, according to Miriam Bradbury from the Bureau of Meteorology. \nThe senior meteorologist said the rain was continuing to fall in many places on Tuesday, prolonging a weather event that officially began on 23 March as an inland low that dragged monsoonal rain from the tropical north to the arid south, but has been complicated by the likes of Dianne. \n\u201cFrom the 23rd onwards we\u2019ve seen huge amounts of rain falling across western and inland Queensland,\u201d Bradbury said. \n\u201cAcross some parts of southern and south west Queensland, several locations have exceeded their annual average rainfall in just a three-day period.\u201d \nThe meteorologists said most areas under flood warnings should see widespread clearing of skies by Thursday, but that forecasting the rain had been made \u201cso challenging\u201d by \u201cone rainfall event flowing into the next\u201d. \n\u201cFor places around Birdsville those rivers are still rising \u2026 and have actually seen multiple flood peaks move through,\u201d she said. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \n\u201cIt rises, it comes down a little, and then it rises again as that next bout of rain moves through the catchment. \n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly caused massive and long lasting disruption\u201d. \nWhile the channel country of the outback south west was used to periodic flooding, Bradbury said such a \u201chuge amount of rain\u201d over a period of days \u201csets this apart from other events\u201d. \n\u201cThat\u2019s what is going to make it remembered very distinctly,\u201d she said. \nBut amid the challenges and the loss, Rowlands said the normally dusty flood plains around his home town were already lush and green and \u201cpretty magic\u201d. \nAnd when the waters do recede, he expects these landscapes, normally among the harshest in the world, to explode with life. \n\u201cMate the country will be like a garden,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a sea of flowers\u201d.", "Bigger than Texas: the true size of Australia\u2019s devastating floods [2025-04-04T14:00:57Z]": "The extent of flood waters that have engulfed Queensland over the past fortnight is so widespread it has covered an area more than four times the size of the United Kingdom. The inundation is larger than France and Germany combined \u2013 and is even bigger than Texas. \nThe seemingly endless plains of outback Queensland are so vast and remote as to boggle any attempts to visualise the scale of what is being described as one of the most devastating floods in living memory. \nThe Bureau of Meteorology said on Friday that the flooding had \u201cseverely impacted\u201d more catchments spanning about 1m sq km since prolonged downpours began drenching south-west and central Queensland on 23 March. \nTo put that in perspective, Tasmania is 15 times smaller (64,519 sq km or 24,911 sq miles); the land area of the United Kingdom is 241,930 sq km, and Texas is 695,662 sq km. \nThe flooded area is more than four times the size of Victoria (227,038 sq km) and bigger than New South Wales (801,137 sq km). It is about the same size as Egypt and about half the size of Saudi Arabia or Mexico. \nIf the flooding were a country, it would be the 31st largest on Earth. \nThe bureau said many stations across the Queensland and New South Wales interior had broken their March or annual rainfall records. \n\u201cIn four days (from 23 to 26 March) parts of southern and south-western Queensland had more than their annual average rainfall,\u201d a BoM spokesperson said. \n\u201cWidespread major flooding continues for parts of Queensland and far northern New South Wales [and] this is likely to continue for many weeks as flood waters slowly move downstream. \n\u201cFlood water will drain slowly towards Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre through the south-west Queensland catchments, with a clearer picture of what may eventuate as flood peaks begin to move downstream.\u201d \n Interactive \n \nTiny, far-flung towns have been evacuated \u2013 in some, such as Adavale, every resident has departed. Others will remain cut off for weeks, despite the heavy rain having passed, as the deluge slowly makes way through flat and sodden country via slow moving rivers. \nAlong with the loss of property and damage to homes, farmers were bracing for the slowly receding water to reveal the extent of agricultural devastation. \nThe premier, David Crisafulli, told the Queensland parliament on Thursday afternoon that the number of livestock lost to flood water had gone past 150,000. \n\u201cI do believe that, sadly, that number will continue to rise in days ahead,\u201d Crisafulli said. \nThe premier said 4,552km of fencing had been destroyed. \nSpeaking from Longreach earlier in the week, he said of particular concern was the loss of exclusion fencing that protected stock from canine depredation, which had been rolled out over recent decades and was crucial to the survival of the sheep industry. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nRoyal Flying Doctors Service base support manager in Charleville, Liane Spencer, said communities like Yowah had been cut off from health care for weeks and were relying on helicopters to drop off medication \u2013 as well as food and fodder \u2013 and to extract people who needed medical attention. \nThat lack of primary health care could have \u201creally major impacts\u201d on the largely elderly communities with some \u201cvery complex medical situations,\u201d she said. In addition to the physical challenges, Spencer said there would be \u201ca lot of very sad people around the country\u201d. \n\u201cThere\u2019s been so many homes inundated, they\u2019ve basically had to walk off with just clothes on their back \u2013 leave their pets and leave their stock \u2013 and then come back to the unknown,\u201d she said. \n \n  Related: One Australian\u2019s dramatic rescue from a flood in one of the driest places on Earth  \n \n\u201cAnd they\u2019re coming back and finding dead kangaroos in their garden, dead pigs in their chook pens and then, once they can get out and about a little bit, just seeing the impact that it has had on their own livestock \u2026 that has ramifications. \n\u201cSome property owners just can\u2019t come back from that \u2013 so there will be a lot of mental health issues ongoing for a long time.\u201d \nDr Piet Filet from Griffith University\u2019s Australian Rivers Institute said that some stock that survived the flood waters would be battling heavy clays and thick mud and would be at risk of sickness. \nBut Filet said the vast inundation would also replenish parched soils, recharge the groundwater systems upon which outback communities and industries are dependent for drinking and agricultural water and bring ephemeral ecosystems bursting into life. \n\u201cFlooding is the natural process through which our soil fertility is maintained,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThere are places out there that hadn\u2019t seen rain for two to three years. \n\u201cThis is the pulse of western Queensland.\u201d", "Northern NSW braces for heavy rain as Queensland flooding forecast to move south [2025-04-02T07:27:16Z]": "Hundreds of emergency workers have been deployed in northern New South Wales as the impact of heavy rain and flooding in Queensland moves south.

We\u2019ve made it to day six of the campaign and gaffes about the price of bread or the rate of unemployment have not made headlines (yet?). Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton both started their days in Victoria, talking big on the economy before the Trump administration\u2019s latest tariff announcement. The PM jetted off to Tasmania before midday to plug a healthcare hub but still had time to read to small children in Melbourne, while the opposition leader toured the outskirts of the city, partaking in tea with a mortgage-stressed family and visiting a mental health centre. Meanwhile, the Greens have been in the flood-stricken NSW town of Richmond, launching an election plan to increase environment spending. Today\u2019s big stories    The Greens have promised to push the government to boost environment spending to $7.8bn \u2013 1% of the federal budget \u2013 next financial year if they hold the balance of power after the election. The party\u2019s pitch came as the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor (pictured), delivered his budget reply at the National Press Club in Canberra, declaring the \u201celection is about the economy\u201d and flagging a small business policy package to be unveiled \u201cover the coming weeks\u201d. Speaking of things yet to be unveiled (the clock\u2019s ticking!), Dutton hasn\u2019t ruled out cuts to the ABC and is still refusing to say which public servants will be axed as part of his plan to slash 41,000 jobs. Pressed on when the costings would be released, Taylor said he wouldn\u2019t delve into the \u201csausage-making process\u201d but it would be before the federal election.

Imagine the downforce from the propellers and they are trying to scramble along a roof underneath it.\u201d \nCowley described seeing the helicopter that picked up his neighbour crash in a nearby yard and watching as the \u201cpilot was swept down the creek about 2km onto a tree\u201d before he was rescued alogn with the neighbour. \nSpeaking from Longreach on Wednesday morning, Crisafulli said that 90 people from Thargomindah were in an evacuation centre as flood waters continued to rise there and that he had also met with residents of Jundah who had been evacuated to Longreach. \n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that some of the smaller communities, Adavale, Jundah, have really copped a beating through this\u201d. \nAs well as damage to property, the premier said the magnitude of stock losses \u201ccontinues to rise\u201d \u2013 with the latest estimate of lost or dead livestock \u201cnow approaching 150,000\u201d. \n\u201cThat\u2019s somewhere in the order of 70,000 cattle, 70,000 sheep and 10,000 goats and horses,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, I stress, this number will continue to rise. This is only the first stage of the damage assessments\u201d. \nThe agricultural industry will also have to patch or rebuild about 4,700km of private roads that have been affected and about 3,500km of fencing, with Crisafulli highlighting the need to rebuild exclusion fencing rolled out over recent decades to protect the sheep industry from canine depredation \u2013 or face a return of what he called \u201cthe bad old days of wild dogs roaming free\u201d. \n\u201cThis is not going to be a recovery that happens in days or weeks, this recovery will take months and years,\u201d he said. \nThe recovery will include the construction of a $10m new weather radar in western Queensland after the federal emergency management minister, Jenny McAllister, said Labor would match a commitment made by the Coalition on Monday.", "How historic is what we\u2019re seeing in the Queensland floods? It\u2019s hard to grasp the full magnitude [2025-04-05T20:00:35Z]": "When Dorothea Mackellar wrote of flooding rains more than a century ago, she couldn\u2019t have anticipated anything on the scale of the current deluge in Queensland. \nThe downpour, which began as a lingering low-pressure trough topped up by rain from ex-Tropical Cyclone Dianne, has dumped a phenomenal amount of water on to outback towns and cities, inundating homes, cutting access to communities and causing stock losses in excess of 150,000. \n \n Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter \n \nThe resulting floods \u2013 the boom in the boom-bust cycle that characterises this arid landscape \u2013 have filled dryland rivers and expanded across wide and flat plains, reaching a scale not seen since European colonisation. \nHow exceptional was the flooding? \nGriffith University professor Fran Sheldon, a river ecologist specialising in dryland river systems, says the floods were \u201cmassive\u201d and \u201cprobably at the extreme end of the boom\u201d. \n\u201cIt\u2019s covering flood plain areas that haven\u2019t been inundated in European memory,\u201d she says, although evidence from soils and fish genetics suggest floods of this scale have happened before.&nbsp;&nbsp; \nInland flood waters are expected to take weeks, or even months, to move downstream into South Australia, towards Kati Thanda\u2013Lake Eyre. \n Interactive \n \nKati Thanda\u2019s river catchment spans 1.2m sq km \u2013 more than a seventh of the Australian landmass \u2013 including parts of Queensland, South Australia, the Northern Territory and New South Wales. Rainfall and river flows are extremely variable, fluctuating between long dry periods and sporadic rainfall. \nAccording to flood gauges, the enormous body of water has surpassed the 1974 event, widely considered the largest flood in Queensland history. But it was still sitting within the floodplain, Sheldon says, just \u201creaching the edges\u201d of where people thought it would go. \nThis was a natural phenomenon, Sheldon says, even though the devastation experienced by towns and communities was awful. \n\u201cThe beauty of these river systems is that they are some of the last unregulated rivers in the world. What we\u2019re witnessing is just rivers being rivers. There are no big dams on these systems. There\u2019s no massive irrigation industry. So this is just what big rivers do.\u201d \nSo much water, where did it all come from? \nAbout two weeks ago, heavy and relentless rain started falling across normally dry inland areas of Queensland as a slow-moving trough dragged tropical moisture inland. \nThe skies briefly cleared this week before the remnants of ex-Tropical Cyclone Dianne brought further rain to already sodden areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; \nRainfall records have tumbled across the state. \n \n  Related: Bigger than Texas: the true size of Australia\u2019s devastating floods  \n \nAccording to the Bureau of Meteorology, broad areas of western Queensland received up to four times their March average rainfall. In four days \u2013 from 23 to 26 March \u2013 parts of southern and south-western Queensland had more than their annual average rainfall. \nThe airport at Winton, Australia\u2019s dinosaur capital, recorded 158mm on 26 March, 56mm higher than the previous daily rainfall record for March. A day later, 177mm fell at Dillalah station, off the Mitchell Highway about 700km west of Brisbane, breaking its record by 31mm. The pastoral lease received so much rain throughout March \u2013 417mm in total \u2013 it nearly doubled its monthly rain record. \nThe bureau said the Paroo, Bulloo, Cooper and Thomson catchments recorded their biggest floods in 50 years. \nThe lingering trough, together with ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred, resulted in the state\u2019s third-wettest March. \nDr Andrew King, an associate professor in climate science at the University of Melbourne, says when low-pressure systems drew air down from the north, it tended to be warm and moist, creating perfect conditions for heavy rainfall. \nFlooding in northern Australia during the wet season isn\u2019t uncommon, he says, although it is unusual to see multiple exceptional flooding events.&nbsp; \nWhile winds generally move weather systems across the country, King says sometimes low-pressure systems linger and get \u201ckind of stuck in place for a while\u201d if there is a high pressure system nearby. \u201cIf the systems hang around for long enough, then the flooding tends to be worse.\u201d  \nThere isn\u2019t yet conclusive evidence about whether climate change is contributing to these stationary events, he says, although it is something researchers are looking into. \nClimate change is increasing the amount of moisture the air can hold, which can lead to heavier rainfall.  \nCould we have been more prepared? \nDr John Macintosh, a water engineer and former National Committee on Water Engineering of Engineers Australia chair, says that in inland rural Australia, infrastructure such as dams, levees or diversions do little to reduce the impact when such huge volumes of water are involved. \nMore moisture in the atmosphere created the conditions for higher rainfall, which could spread further across a flat landscape, he says.&nbsp; \n\u201cMore volume of water \u2026 means we\u2019ve got greater areas that have been impacted,\u201d Macintosh says, all amplified by growing populations, farming and industrial activities. \nGovernments are improving their disaster management capabilities, but he says more early warning and monitoring systems will reduce potential flood damage. Engineers can help, he says, by drawing on rainfall, flood gauge and river flow data and using mapping to better forecast the expected timing and depth of flood events. \nWhere to from here? \nMost of the water currently sitting over Cooper Creek and the Georgina, Diamantina river systems will eventually make its way into Kati Thanda\u2013Lake Eyre. \nThe \u201cgreat big creeping mass of water\u201d is moving at a walking pace, Sheldon says. But once it reaches Kati Thanda \u2013 in weeks or months \u2013 it will probably fill the lake, a rare event that only occurs a few times each century. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at something pretty unique,\u201d she says. \nAs the flood waters progress, wetting soils and filling up rivers and wetlands, nutrients and invertebrates will provide a ready food source for fish and waterbirds. \n\u201cA lot of those floodplain soils contain eggs of small invertebrates, the zooplankton that hatch when they get wet. There\u2019s an instant boom of this incredible food source for fish, and they\u2019ll just be out there feasting and growing and breeding again and making the most of it.\u201d \nWhen the water finally reaches its destination, brine shrimp would hatch from the salty sediment providing food for millions of waterbirds. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not just Kati Thanda that will boom. All these wetlands will be covered in water birds and be covered in fish and be booming as well,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be spectacular.\u201d", "The disaster relief payments you may be eligible for after western Queensland\u2019s flooding and ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred [2025-04-06T01:16:42Z]": "Within just one month, Australia has faced a series of devastating weather events, from ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred wreaking havoc in northern New South Wales and south-east Queensland, to flooding in western Queensland. In response, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, alongside state governments, has announced several types of disaster relief assistance to support those affected. \u201cAt the worst of times we see the best of the Australian character,\u201d Albanese said in Longreach in western Queensland on Saturday. \u201cMy message to Queenslanders in this difficult time is we\u2019ve got your back and will support you through the recovery.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know about the support on offer.  What did Albanese announce for western Queensland?   Following heavy rainfall and flooding in western Queensland, which began on 21 March, Albanese announced the disaster recovery allowance would be available for 15 affected local government areas. They are: Barcaldine, Barcoo, Blackall-Tambo, Boulia, Bulloo, Central Highlands, Diamantina, Flinders, Longreach, Maranoa, Murweh, Paroo, Quilpie, Richmond and Winton. This allowance offers up to 13 weeks of income support for eligible workers and sole traders depending on their personal circumstances who have suffered a loss of income as a direct result of the event. He also announced $105m, jointly funded with the Queensland government, to repair thousands of kilometres of exclusion fencing damaged by flood waters so far, to protect livestock from feral pigs and dogs. An additional $7m will also be spend on fodder for livestock. Who is eligible for the disaster recovery allowance?   To be eligible you must be:  Sixteen years or older. A worker or sole trader who has suffered a loss of income as a direct result of the event. Able to prove your income has fallen below the average Australian weekly income as a result of the floods. Living in one of the 15 LGAs affected by the Queensland floods or the 31 declared cyclone-affected areas in south-east Queensland and northern NSW.  You can check your eligibility here. How much is the disaster recovery allowance?  Money will be paid fortnightly at either the jobseeker or youth allowance rates, depending on your personal circumstances.

[2025-04-04T23:00:06Z]": "Trump\u2019s sweeping new tariffs have left global markets in turmoil and Norfolk Islanders scratching their heads. Politicians, economists, and everyday people around the world have been scrambling to understand what it all means and what happens next. \nWhile officials in Canada, Europe and China talk tough, the response in Australia has been more muted. \nThat tells us two things. \nFirst, that we don\u2019t export a huge amount to the US, and there is a rare consensus that trying to retaliate would only hurt us more. \nSecond, that with the new tax on Australian goods exported to the US of \u201conly\u201d 10%, we have escaped relatively lightly \u2013 especially as pharmaceuticals have so far been exempted. \nBut our leaders must be seen to be doing something. \nSo it was that Anthony Albanese on Thursday immediately announced a range of measures designed to soften the blow to those local exporters who might get hurt by US trade aggression \u2013 either indirectly, or directly. \n \n Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter \n \nAnd first cab off the rank from the PM was this pledge: \u201cWe will strengthen our anti-dumping regime to safeguard key sectors like steel, aluminium and manufacturing against unfair competition.\u201d \nWhat is dumping, and why are we so worried? \nThe fear is that countries who have now been slapped with much higher US tariffs, such as China and Vietnam, could struggle to sell their products in America and choose instead to dump them at below cost in other markets \u2013 such as Australia. \n \n  Related: Trump\u2019s tariffs could deliver a $27bn blow to Australia \u2013 and the cost of a global trade war would be far higher  \n \nThat could hurt local manufacturers who can\u2019t compete with imported goods being sold at unfairly low prices. In the worst-case scenario, they could be forced out of business. \nHow likely is that? \nA flood of cheap imports at fire sale prices is not in the immediate future. \nBut it\u2019s hard to know how worried we should be, and the risk of a rise in dumping cases is higher than it was on Wednesday. \nFor now, talk of beefed-up anti-dumping measures is mostly just that \u2013 talk. Behind the scenes, diplomats and trade representatives will be talking with their overseas counterparts to stop an unruly rush to dump unwanted goods in each others\u2019 markets. \nThe government plans to spend an extra $5m to boost the capacity of the Anti-Dumping Commission to deal with a potential increase in the number of cases. \nThe commission, which sits in the Department of Industry, investigates claims by local producers who say they are the victim of unfair trading practices by overseas competitors. \nIs dumping always bad? \nNot if there isn\u2019t a local producer who is being unfairly disadvantaged. \nFor example, China could choose to \u201cdump\u201d cut-price electric vehicles on our shores. With no local car manufacturers, that would just mean cheaper cars for us. \nWho decides whether goods have been dumped? \nThe industry minister of the day will make the call, based on the recommendation in a final report presented by the Anti-Dumping Commissioner. \nThe final report is supposed to be produced within 155 days of the complaint being lodged, although cases can start, stop and restart. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nThe process to lodge a complaint is long and arduous, though, and the paperwork is hideous, says Louise McGrath, the head of industry development and policy at Ai Group. That puts off a lot of would-be complaints, especially by smaller firms. \nSome companies, however, are practised complainants. \nIn fact there is the risk that anti-dumping rules can be exploited by local firms trying to shield themselves from offshore competitors who are simply more efficient. \nJenny Gordon, a non-resident fellow at the Lowy Institute, uses the example of the steel manufacturer, Bluescope, which she says \u201cexcessively used antidumping to limit competition\u201d. \n\u201cAs a result Australians pay more, and that raises building costs,\u201d Gordon says. \nSo which products are already on the naughty list? \nThe Anti-Dumping Commission\u2019s website lists 24 imported products or commodities that have been found to be sold in Australia at unfairly low prices and are paying the penalty. \n \n  Related: Breaking with the US will be painful for Australia in many ways \u2013 but it\u2019s inevitable | John Quiggin  \n \nThey are almost all manufactured metal products, and predominantly from China and other Asian countries. For example: aluminium extrusions from China, Malaysia and Vietnam; chrome bars from Romania; and quenched and tempered steel plate from Finland, Japan and Sweden. There\u2019s clear float glass from Indonesia, and pineapples from the Philippines. \nSo-called \u201ccountervailing duties\u201d are applied to these products to lift their prices to reflect the commission\u2019s estimate of a fair price. \nThese extra taxes are applied to individual manufacturers, and they can be very high. \nFor example, aluminium extrusions imported from four Thai firms have an effective duty rate of 64.4%, according to the Anti-Dumping Commission\u2019s website. \nOn the other hand, the same product from three Vietnamese manufacturers of the same commodity is 5.2%. \nSo what\u2019s next? \nGreat question. \nTrump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs are due to come into effect just past midnight on 9 April, Washington DC time. \nBetween now and then countries may be able to negotiate a lower rate by offering Trump what he wants \u2013 assuming they know what that is. \nFor now, we will have to wait and see.", "Morning Mail: Trump tariffs trigger Wall Street slump, Liberal candidate\u2019s fringe views, Gen Z\u2019s gender voter divide [2025-04-03T19:46:09Z]": "Morning everyone.

That\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave things. Here are the main takeaways: \n   \n   Anthony Albanese began day seven of the campaign in Melbourne to tout the government\u2019s \u201csame job, same pay\u201d laws, while Peter Dutton was in Western Australia, announcing $600m for roads critical to mining and agriculture. \n   The day was quickly overshadowed by news Australia had been hit with a 10% tariff on all imports to the US. \n   In response, the prime minister said this was \u201cnot the act of a friend\u201d and would have \u201cconsequences\u201d for how Australians views the US-Australia relationship. \n   Albanese said his government would not respond with reciprocal tariffs, but would use \u201cevery asset\u201d available in talks with the US.

Additional work was identified as required. \n   \n  \n Updated at 8.28am BST \n \n \n  7.00am BST  \n Dutton campaign lands in Busselton, WA \n  \n  Peter Dutton has touched down in Busselton, Western Australia for a brief local visit to the seat of Forrest. We\u2019ve jumped off the plane for a quick press conference just outside the airport. \n  The rain is coming down so this might be a short media appearance. The seat is held by the Coalition MP Nola Marino, who is retiring. Ben Small, formerly a Liberal senator, is running to replace her. \n  Dutton is announcing $16m to upgrade the airport at Busselton here. \n  \n Updated at 8.28am BST \n \n \n  6.58am BST  \n  \n  Shadow trade minister continues Coalition argument it could have achieved different tariff outcome \n  The shadow trade minister, Kevin Hogan, is continuing the Coalition\u2019s argument it would have been able to achieve a different outcome on tariffs for Australia. \n  Speaking on the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing, he argued Mexico and Canada were able to get exemptions and \u201cwe know, as a dealmaker, we could have potentially gotten a deal like Canada and Mexico\u201d. \n  Host Patricia Karvelas pointed out that Canada and Mexico were slapped with tariffs, along with the rest of the world, and that cumulatively Australia has had less of an impact. Hogan, though, argued: \n   \n   While we just highlighted where Canada and Mexico did get slapped with tariffs, most goods and services they sell to each other through their FTA\u2019s have been made exempt \u2026 And as Arthur just said, Trump is still open to negotiations on these things, we know he\u2019s transactional, leader to leader, so there\u2019s still possibilities to get a better deal. \n   \n  Karvelas also quoted Sinodinos, who said the \u201cTrump administration are determined to have higher tariffs \u2026 by minimising exemptions and exceptions\u201d. Hogan continued his argument though, saying: \u201cI think there are examples, like Canada, like Mexico, that have had products made exempt.\u201d \n  So, if Peter Dutton got a phone call with Donald Trump, would he have truly walked away with a deal when no other country did? Hogan didn\u2019t specify how, but still said, \u201cwe got a deal previously\u201d. \n   \n   I do agree [with] most of the points you have made. Trump is a believer in tariffs, the people around him believe in this. It is going to be a difficult thing to do, but you have to give it your best shot and I do not think necessarily we have. \n   \n  \n Updated at 8.31am BST \n \n \n  6.48am BST  \n  \n  Sinodinos says he encouraged Americans to approach Australia over differences on beef \n  Arthur Sinodinos said that the Trump administration should have approached Australia when it came to differences on beef, saying: \n   \n   What should have happened here is that Trump administration should have come to the Australian government and said, look, we have certain issues around beef, there is a lack of reciprocity, can we review the way you do things on biosecurity, consistent with your standards, so that we can get greater access? I mean, I encouraged the Americans to do that. We all did. I think that would have been a better way to go than what has happened here. \n   \n  So, the US didn\u2019t do that or did Australia just not respond? The former ambassador said: \n   \n   I think the issue was just let go and let slip and never really properly focused on. The urgent always crowds out the important. \n   \n  In his speech today, Donald Trump singled out Australia\u2019s ban on the import of US beef \u2013 imposed in 2003 after the US had cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. \n   \n    Related: Donald Trump hits Australian exporters with 10% tariffs in \u2018liberation day\u2019 speech  \n   \n  \n \n \n  6.44am BST  \n  \n  Former US ambassador says Australia shouldn\u2019t \u2018lightly throw away assets like Pine Gap\u2019 \n  On Pine Gap, and whether that should be part of any negotiations with the US to get an exemption, Arthur Sinodinos said it was \u201crash\u201d for \u201cAustralia to put security installations like that on the table\u201d. \n   \n   These things have a value in their own right, [but] they are not pawns in a trade game \u2026 If we look like we are prepared to trade with the defence and security relationship in order to get a trade advantage, that is not to a longer term strategic advantage. \n   A longer term strategic advantage is to keep the US locked into this region, by being a strong partner to the US and explaining to them why their tied up with the security of countries like us in the Indo-Pacific. We don\u2019t lightly throw away assets like Pine Gap. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.01am BST \n \n \n  6.41am BST  \n  \n  \u2018Much tougher to get a deal on tariffs this time than 2018\u2019, Sinodinos says \n  Arthur Sinodinos was asked about claims from the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, that he would have somehow been able to achieve a different outcome on tariffs for Australia. \n  (No other country was exempted, and when asked how he would have achieved this at an earlier press conference, Dutton could not answer specifically.) \n  Sinodinos said it would have been \u201cmuch tougher to get a deal this time around than say in 2018\u201d. \n   \n   The Trump administration are determined to have higher tariffs. They believe that will generate revenue, they want the protective effect, and they believe they get that by minimising exemptions and exceptions. \n   But as usual with the president, he is leaving the door open. We will see what that means in terms of potential negotiations of individual country deals, but it is a hard environment for any country to get an exception here in the US at the moment. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.44am BST \n \n \n  6.37am BST  \n  \n  Former ambassador to the US weighs in on further tariffs \n  Former Liberal senator and ambassador to the US Arthur Sinodinos is up on ABC Afternoon Briefing to weigh in on the latest tariffs. \n  He said it was true Australia \u201cdidn\u2019t cop it much as many other countries,\u201d but argued the broader impact was relevant: \n   \n   What we have to be concerned about is that there will be retaliation, potentially by the major blocks \u2013 like the EU as well as the Chinese and others \u2013 and what does this mean about global trade and investment? \n   We are successful trading nation, we rely on trade, so we are in a situation now where I think we\u2019re going be buffeted by some very choppy waters and a lot of uncertainty in global business tonight about how they\u2019re going to handle these tariffs. \n   \n  Sinodinos said that whoever is elected prime minister should \u201ccome to the US pretty quickly and eyeball the president\u201d, and have a \u201cleader to leader\u201d conversation on this. \n  \n Updated at 6.45am BST \n \n \n  6.31am BST  \n  \n  Man charged with intimidation after alleged antisemitic comments \n  A man has been charged with intimidation after an alleged antisemitic incident in Sydney earlier this year. \n  NSW police said they have been investigating reports of antisemitic comments directed at a Kogarah hospital staff member in a lift on 28 February. \n  Officers arrested a 24-year-old man in Arncliffe this morning, who was taken to St George police station and charged with stalking and intimidation, and possessing violent extremist material. \n  He was refused bail to appear in Sutherland local court today. \n  Police said two mobile phones have been taken for further examination, after being seized when a search warrant was executed at premises in Arncliffe. \n  \n Updated at 6.34am BST \n \n \n  6.24am BST  \n  \n  Wong responds to Keating\u2019s suggestion that Trump tariffs signal end of NATO \n  Wrapping up the interview, Penny Wong was asked about comments from former PM Paul Keating that Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcement \u201crepresents the effective death knell of NATO\u201d. \n  She said the government\u2019s job was to \u201ccontinue to seek strategic stability,\u201d including Australia\u2019s strategic partnership with the US and Aukus. \n   \n   In relation to Nato, I think it is important to remember Nato is a very important contributor to global peace and stability. There is no doubt we live in an uncertain world \u2026 a world where we see more conflict and frankly more division. Our job, from Australia\u2019s perspective, is to be a voice for continued engagement, continued strategic stability, because that underpins peace. \n   \n  Are those institutions still in good health? Wong answered: \n   \n   I do not believe suggesting that they are ending is in Australia\u2019s interest. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.26am BST \n \n \n  6.20am BST  \n  \n  Wong says direct negotiation over tariffs preferable to WTO \n  Asked about whether Australia might take the US to the World Trade Organization over the latest tariffs, Penny Wong said the government\u2019s preference was to negotiate directly: \n   \n   We have dispute resolution mechanisms available to us, both within the free-trade agreement and at the WTO. Our preference is to negotiate directly and to try to resolve this. That is what would like to do and what the government will be doing certainly if we are re-elected. \n   \n  \n \n \n  6.19am BST  \n  \n  Should Australia revisit its restriction on US beef? \n  Penny Wong said Australia\u2019s biosecurity decisions should be guided by science: \n   \n   I want science the guide that process, it\u2019s important for Australia and our industries and for our reputation that we ensure that our biosecurity is scientifically based. \n   \n  Is the science still saying we must have this restrictions? Wong suggested it is: \n   \n   As I understand \u2013 it is obviously not my portfolio \u2013 that process is not yet finalised to the extent that that position could be changed, and we certainly don\u2019t propose to be compromising our bio security regime. \n   \n  \n \n \n  6.17am BST  \n  \n  Wong says reciprocal tariffs would put costs on Australian consumers \n  Does Penny Wong think Australia can live with a 10% tariff, because getting out of it might be too costly for our country? \n  She told host Patricia Karlevas that \u201cI don\u2019t agree with how you have put that\u201d. \n   \n   Let\u2019s remember tariffs are paid by the US consumer, ultimately. That is where the cost of tariffs fall. That is why we are not going down the path of reciprocal tariffs \u2013 that is putting Australian tariffs on because we know that would be making Australian consumers pay the price of this difference of views on a trade. \n   \n  Wong said Australia would \u201ccontinue to put our view very clearly\u201d to the US and \u201cdiversify our economic relationships\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 6.21am BST \n \n \n  6.14am BST  \n  \n  Wong says defence relationship with US important \u2018regardless of disagreements on economic policy\u2019 \n  Asked about Australia\u2019s defence relationship with the US amid the tariff announcements, and whether Pine Gap should play a role in any negotiations, Penny Wong responded: \n   \n   I think it\u2019s very important that we continue to preserve and protect our strategic relationship and our institutional relationship with the United States. \n   \n  The foreign affairs minister said she was \u201csurprised that Peter Dutton would be so reckless as to suggest a different approach.\u201d \n   \n   We think it is important to remember the US administration, regardless of our disagreements on economic policy, we have a very important strategic relationship with them and we have had for decades. We have a very important relationship when it comes to Aukus and we are pleased with the continued and bipartisan support for Aukus. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.20am BST \n \n \n  6.10am BST  \n  \n  Wong says Dutton \u2018so arrogant as to be delusional\u2019 with claims he could have achieved different tariff outcome \n  The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, says that \u201cno country is in a better position than Australia\u201d after today\u2019s tariff announcements from the United States. \n  Speaking with ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing just now, she said: \n   \n   As the prime minister has made clear, we believe these tariffs are unwarranted \u2013 certainly inconsistent with the free trade agreement \u2013 and they go against the spirit of the friendship between our two countries. \n   \n  But Wong said that \u201cunlike [Peter] Dutton, we don\u2019t want a deal at any cost\u201d, and took aim at him as being \u201cso arrogant as to be delusional\u201d. \n   \n   He seriously thinks he uniquely, amongst all leaders in the world, could have got a better deal. The reality is this is the decision president Trump and his administration have made. It is central to their political and economic strategy. We disagree with it for the reasons the prime minister has outlined. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.16am BST \n \n \n  5.58am BST  \n  \n  Impact on American consumers from Trump\u2019s tariffs \n  As the rest of the world chews on the bitter tariff stew served up this morning, spare a thought for American households \u2013 the very ones Trump is claiming he\u2019s there to \u201cmake wealthy again\u201d. \n  The average American will be $US3,800 ($6,000) worse off this year thanks to Trump\u2019s tariff policies, according to Yale University\u2019s recently created thinktank, The Budget Lab. \n  The poorest Americans will be hit the hardest in the short-term as taxes on imports push prices higher. \n  Clothing costs are anticipated to soar by 17%. The lowest income households will suffer a 4% drop in disposable income, versus a 1.6% drop for the wealthiest. \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n   \n  The US\u2019s average effective tariff rate will reach 22.5% thanks to \u201cliberation day\u201d, or the highest since 1909, according to the new analysis. \n  The American economy will be nearly 1% smaller in 2025 thanks to the accumulated levies announced since Trump came to power, and most of that prospective damage is thanks to what was revealed today. \n  And US GDP will be permanently lower by 0.4%. \n  Before we feel too sorry for the US, its northern neighbour, Canada, will fare far worse: its economy will be 2% smaller in the long run. \n  \n Updated at 6.01am BST \n \n \n  5.52am BST  \n  \n  Murray Watt dismisses Dutton\u2019s IR climbdown \n  The workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, has just responded to news Peter Dutton has ruled out repealing \u201csame job, same pay\u201d laws.  \n  Speaking to reporters after Anthony Albanese\u2019s speech to the Mining and Energy Union conference, Watt said: \n   \n   If you believe Peter Dutton on \u2018same job, same pay\u2019, I\u2019ve got a mine shaft to sell you. Peter Dutton and his colleagues voted against the \u2018same job, same pay\u2019 laws. They called it at the time unAustralian and dangerous, they said the laws would close down Australia.  \n   Does anyone really believe they are going to change position from that to all of a sudden start reporting it? \n   \n  \n \n \n  5.46am BST  \n AEC says Abbie Chatfield podcasts did not breach electoral rules \n  \n  The Australian Electoral Commission has cleared podcast host Abbie Chatfield of any wrongdoing and said a review of her content has found it \u201cdoes not require an authorisation statement\u201d. \n  Liberal senators had raised concerns about some of the podcaster\u2019s podcasts and material shared on social media, questioning whether it should have been classed as electoral material, which would require an official authorisation statement. \n  Anthony Albanese and Adam Bandt have both appeared on Chatfield\u2019s podcast in recent weeks. Clips of the interviews were shared on both politician\u2019s social media accounts. Chatfield has separately encouraged her followers to put the Liberal party last on ballot papers. \n  In a statement, an AEC spokesperson said that while the podcasts \u201ccould be viewed as being made for purpose of influencing how someone casts their vote, there is no evidence that there was a monetary benefit for the podcaster as a result of either Albanese or Bandt being invited onto the show\u201d. \n   \n   It appears that the invitations to Albanese or Bandt to participate were voluntary. In addition, questions put to both interviewees were sourced from the podcast\u2019s audience. There is no evidence that either Albanese or Bandt had creative control in relation to the questions that were asked. \n   As such, the AEC is not satisfied that the episodes of Ms Chatfield\u2019s podcasts on 21 February 2025 and 11 March 2025 could be considered to be paid advertising or to be communicated by or on behalf of a candidate or party. This content does not require an authorisation. \n   The AEC is making the outcome of this review public out of fairness to Ms Chatfield given the media coverage of the issue to date. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.50am BST \n \n \n  5.44am BST  \n Albanese tumbles on stage after giving speech in Newcastle \n  \n  Just back to Anthony Albanese\u2019s speech at the Mining and Energy Union conference in the Hunter this afternoon: \n  After delivering the speech, Albanese appeared to stumble on stage, prompting gasps from the union members gathered in the room. He quickly recovered and appears OK. \n  He was also asked about this on ABC Newcastle radio just now, and said: \n   \n   I stepped back one step. I didn\u2019t fall off the stage \u2026 Just one leg went down, but I was sweet. \n   \n   \n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 8.07am BST \n \n \n  5.41am BST  \n  \n  PM on fast rail between Newcastle and Sydney: \u2018We\u2019re going through the business case\u2019 \n  Asked if there will there be money in the campaign for fast rail between Newcastle and Sydney, Anthony Albanese said that work was under way. \n   \n   We\u2019ve already begun that process. We\u2019ve established the office in Newcastle here. We think it\u2019s an exciting proposal. I\u2019ve been a long term supporter of it. The work is being undertaken as we speak, and we\u2019ve already provided funding in the budget. \n   \n  In terms of how soon the high-speed rail could be in place, the prime minister didn\u2019t specify, answering: \n   \n   We\u2019re going through the business case and going through those processes. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.46am BST \n \n \n  5.38am BST  \n  \n  Albanese responds to climate protestors who crashed his press conference \n  Anthony Albanese also weighed in on the climate protestors that crashed his press conference in Maitland today, and said: \n   \n   I think that people screaming in a hospital ward says more about them than advancing their cause. Frankly, I thought it\u2019s [an] entirely inappropriate setting for a couple of people to pose as journalists \u2026 \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.39am BST \n \n \n  5.36am BST  \n  \n  Albanese speaks to local radio in Newcastle about job transition for mining workers \n  The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking with ABC Newcastle this afternoon, declaring he \u201ccertainly\u201d still sees the Hunter as a Labor heartland. \n  Asked if he has lost track with local voters, with a number of local seats considered marginal, Albanese disagreed: \n   \n   Of course, Newcastle \u2026 [has] been represented by the Liberal party at various times. And when people have done that, they\u2019ve come back to Labor pretty quickly, because it\u2019s only Labor that will stand up for values. \n   \n  He was also asked about community concern over the closure of coal mines and the transition for workers, and pointed to the net zero authority \u201cto make sure that communities aren\u2019t left behind\u201d. \n   \n   They\u2019ll help by making sure that we have new jobs created, in addition to support for existing jobs that will be around for some time \u2013 but we want new industries to come to the Hunter. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.37am BST \n \n \n  5.31am BST  \n  \n  Good afternoon! Emily Wind here, I\u2019ll be taking you through the rest of today\u2019s news. \n  \n \n \n  5.29am BST  \n  \n  That\u2019s it from me today, thank you for following me along on the blog. \n  It\u2019s been a huge day, with plenty of reaction to Trump\u2019s announcement on tariffs, and the fabulous Emily Wind will be able to bring you all the rest on that issue and what\u2019s happening on the election trail this afternoon. \n  I\u2019ll catch you all bright and early tomorrow morning! \n  \n Updated at 5.30am BST \n \n \n  5.05am BST  \n  \n  \u2018Same job, same pay\u2019 laws on ballot at election, Albanese says \n  Anthony Albanese is delivering a speech about Labor\u2019s \u201csame job, same pay\u201d laws to a Mining and Energy Union conference in the seat of Hunter, the heart of NSW coal country. \n  For those unfamiliar, the laws came into force last year allowing labour-hire workers to apply to be paid the same amount as directly employed staff doing the same job. \n  Unions in industries including mining and aviation are already capitalising on the new bargaining tool to negotiate pay rises for their workers. \n  The Coalition opposed the laws in federal parliament and vowed to review them if it won election. \n  The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, seemingly walked back that position on Thursday after responding \u201cwe\u2019re not going to\u201d when asked if a Coalition government would reverse the legislation. \n  In his speech to the union conference (almost certainly written before Dutton\u2019s comments), Albanese said the laws were \u201con the ballot paper\u201d at the 3 May federal election. \n   \n   They are promising to abolish Same Job, Same Pay. To take away all those pay rises that workers have earned. Ripping money out of people\u2019s pockets \u2013 and out of communities. Whether it\u2019s your Medicare, your wages or your conditions \u2026. \n   \n  Albanese entered the packed conference room to a standing ovation from union members, before posing for a selfie with the Hunter MP, Dan Repacholi. \n  A report from progressive think tank the McKell Institute, published on Thursday, estimated the \u201csame job, same pay\u201d laws would deliver a wages boost of up to $920.3m each year to workers in industries such as mining, aviation and retail. \n  \n Updated at 5.09am BST \n \n \n  4.53am BST  \n  \n  Uninhabited islands tariffed \n  If you also thought it was a little strange that Norfolk Island (a tiny island that is part of Australian territory) had been included in Trump\u2019s tariffs, well the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands have also been captured. \n  How? Why? Kate Lyons and Nick Evershed have the details here: \n   \n    Related: Trump imposes tariffs on uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands near Antarctica  \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.06am BST \n \n \n  4.36am BST  \n Kim Williams: \u2018No doubt\u2019 Coalition government would initiate review of ABC \n  \n  Jumping out of the campaign and back to Kim Williams at the Melbourne Press Club \u2026 \n  Williams has responded to comments made by Peter Dutton this week where he refused to rule out cuts to the ABC, saying the public broadcaster would need to demonstrate efficiency and excellence: \n  Williams says a \u201cwell-resourced ABC has never been more important\u201d: \n   \n   I don\u2019t think the ABC has anything to apologise for in its continuing quest for excellence and its continuing obligation to operate with efficiency. \n   \n  Asked if he believes a Coalition government would initiate a review of the ABC, Williams replies: \u201cno doubt about it\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 5.11am BST \n \n \n  4.27am BST  \n Rising Tide protest group claims responsibility for crashing PM\u2019s press conference \n  \n  Climate action group Rising Tide says it was its protesters who crashed Anthony Albanese\u2019s media conference a short time ago. \n  The group started in Newcastle, NSW, around the Hunter region, and have been pushing to end all coal exports from Newcastle by 2030. \n  Rising Tide activists have also recently crashed the press conferences of Peter Dutton, Angus Taylor and Jim Chalmers. \n  \n Updated at 5.16am BST \n \n \n  4.15am BST  \n  \n  ABC chair becomes emotional after reading viewer messages on Alfred coverage \n  Williams has become emotional after reading messages from ABC viewers expressing gratitude for the public broadcaster\u2019s coverage of the ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred last month. \n  Williams became teary and said he could read these messages \u201cfor hours\u201d, prompting applause from the audience at the Melbourne Press Club: \n   \n   What we do as members of the media is more than a public service. It\u2019s something inseparable from the workings of the nation. \n   We need an extremely strong and well funded media. We need an extremely strong and well funded ABC.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.50am BST \n \n \n  4.13am BST  \n  \n  ABC chair tells Melbourne Press Club investment in broadcaster is \u2018supporting Australian democracy\u2019 \n  ABC chair Kim Williams is addressing the Melbourne Press Club to mark his first 12 months as chair. His appearance comes the day after the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, hinted he may cut funding to the ABC if it was not efficient or excellent enough. \n  Williams is making a case for supporting the ABC in the interests of democracy, saying the ABC can provide trustworthy independent journalism in the face of a global assault on truth. \n   \n   One direct way of supporting Australian democracy is before our very nose \u2013 to properly invest in the ABC. \n   We perform as well as we can with the allocations provided, and we are grateful to the Australian government for providing it to enable the ABC to serve audiences. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.43am BST \n \n \n  4.09am BST  \n PM\u2019s media conference crashed by climate protesters \n  \n  A touch earlier, the PM did a quick press conference as well, in the NSW Hunter region, where he was talking up the government\u2019s promise for more Medicare urgent care clinics. \n  Albanese was asked to respond to Peter Dutton\u2019s reaction to the tariffs and said: \n   \n   Peter Dutton doesn\u2019t have any plans, [his] plan is to move into Kirribilli House to measure up the curtains. What we\u2019ve done is to stand up for Australian interests. \n   \n  But two climate protesters crashed that media conference as the PM was talking about supporting the region and its coal industry: \n   \n   We want to make sure as the transition happens \u2013 we have established a net zero authority \u2013 what that\u2019s about is making sure no community gets left behind. We support the coal industry. \n   \n  The protesters yelled \u201cMr Albanese, why did your government approve 33 new fossil fuel projects?\u201d \n   \n   It\u2019s my future, it has to stop. \n   \n  The protesters were quickly ushered out of the building by security. \n  \n Updated at 4.37am BST \n \n \n  3.57am BST  \n  \n  Dutton pressed on how he would negotiate tariffs with US \n  Dutton is tested again on what exactly he would put on the table in negotiations with the Trump administration. \n  One reporter asks whether Australians even want a fight with the US? Dutton replies: \n   \n   Well, you bet that we\u2019re going to get the best deal for our country, and we can do that through strong leadership. \n   \n  He\u2019s asked whether a Dutton government would be willing to withhold assets or from the US, but Dutton says his approach would be the \u201copposite\u201d. \n   \n   It\u2019s about what we can bring to the table in a bigger deal with the United States. I think there is opportunity for us to take what is a bad decision, and decision I\u2019m dead against, that\u2019s been made by the president. \n   There\u2019s huge market opportunity in the US, the critical mineral development out of WA can supply the US supply chain, and we can have assurances, because we\u2019re a trusted partner, there is enormous opportunity. But the prime minister hasn\u2019t spoken about any of that to President Trump \u2026 \n   \n  Again, the Albanese has said that the government did negotiate with the Trump administration on critical minerals after the first set of tariffs on steel and aluminium were announced. (You can recap that here). \n  Dutton is asked point blank by another reporter if there is a \u201cstick\u201d that can be used against the US. \n  He doesn\u2019t directly answer the question, he just says the US \u201cvalue the relationship we have with them\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 4.23am BST \n \n \n  3.49am BST  \n  \n  Dutton claims Labor delaying North West Shelf gas decision \n  Peter Dutton is speaking to media again from Perth, and he\u2019s pushing hard on mining (specifically that the Coalition heavily supports the mining industry). \n  Dutton has accused Labor of delaying a decision on the extension of the North West Shelf gas project in WA. \n   \n   I think what it says to everybody in WA who is reliant on or connected with this sector, with this incredible mining sector, that you can\u2019t trust Mr Albanese, and he certainly can\u2019t trust a minority Labor-Greens government. \n   \n  The first question to Dutton goes to whether a Coalition government would repeal the same job, same pay IR laws that the Labor government has put in. \n  Dutton says they won\u2019t and then goes to what he\u2019s said previously on IR, that he\u2019ll deregister the construction union, the CFMEU, which is under administration. \n   \n   We\u2019re not going to. And we\u2019ve said right from the start the big difference on industrial relations policy at the next election between us and the Labor Party will be that we\u2019re going to deregister the CFMEU. The CFMEU would be a disaster for the Pilbara. The CFMEU would be a disaster across every mining site. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.09am BST \n \n \n  3.41am BST  \n Wong dismisses Dutton over \u2018captain obvious\u2019 suggestions for tariff response \n  \n  The foreign minister, Penny Wong, says the US administration\u2019s tariffs are a \u201cpoor decision\u201d. \n  Wong is asked on Sky News to respond to Peter Dutton\u2019s suggestion that there is a pathway to resolving the issues if there\u2019s a \u201cwill\u201d. \n  Wong calls Dutton \u201ccaptain obvious\u201d, suggesting the government is doing everything he\u2019s pointed out already, and called him \u201creckless\u201d. \n   \n   Peter Dutton seems to think he\u2019s Superman, but he\u2019s actually Captain Obvious. He suggests that this is a time for negotiation, well, that is what we have been doing. He suggests we should be discussing critical minerals, I\u2019m sure he will recall it\u2019s quite been quite public, that is, that is what we have been doing \u2026 \n   But really, what we saw from Mr Dutton today is more reckless arrogance. We saw him today talking down Australia. \n   \n  Wong says, as she mentioned during her press conference with the prime minister, that this is a time for unity across politics, and warns Dutton to \u201cstop his relentless carping\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 3.58am BST \n \n \n  3.25am BST  \n  \n  Peter Dutton\u2019s WA tour continues, arriving at a manufacturing business in the Perth electorate of Hasluck. He\u2019s checking out a factory and warehouse which makes drilling equipment.  \n  He\u2019s already done his main press conference for the day, so we\u2019re expecting him to do a tour as a photo opportunity, and then to make some remarks - launching the Coalition\u2019s $600 million pledge on road infrastructure for mining and agriculture areas.  \n  Hasluck is held by Labor on a 10% margin, so not necessarily at the top of the \u201cat risk\u201d column for Anthony Albanese - but Dutton needs to make some serious inroads in the west, so he\u2019s shooting high with some ambitious visits.  \n  \n \n \n  3.18am BST  \n  \n  Queensland doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll adopt a gas reserve policy - instead trusting in rolling out more supply.  \n  Mount Isa-based MP Robbie Katter asked if the LNP state government was considering following Peter Dutton\u2019s lead in question time this morning.  \n  \u201cWithout it, Phosphate Hill, Mount Isa mine and the town\u2019s refinery are all at risk,\u201d he said. \n   \n    Related: Is Dutton\u2019s gas plan just hot air? - podcast  \n   \n  Minister for natural resources Dale Last didn\u2019t answer that question, but he did make it clear he wants the industry in Queensland to expand.  \n   \n   We have ample gas reserves, ample gas supplies. And as I\u2019ve been saying to my gas companies in this state - I\u2019ll sign, you drill. And that\u2019s a message that we\u2019re taking out across Queensland to develop our gas reserves, to bring them online, because that is prosperity for Queensland, and that is jobs for Queensland. \n   \n  Last cited the Australian market supply condition process and the Australian domestic gas security mechanism, which require more gas to be used locally.  \n  He went on to say that \u201cthere\u2019s no gas crisis in this state\u201d.  \n  \n \n \n  3.13am BST  \n  \n  PM heads to Paterson \n  After landing in the NSW Hunter region, Anthony Albanese has made a beeline for the electorate of Paterson. \n  Labor backbencher Meryl Swanson holds the seat on a margin of 2.6% but faces a serious threat from the Liberals, who believe it is winnable in part because of community unrest over a proposed offshore wind zone in Port Stephens. \n  Albanese will visit Maitland hospital to spruik his promise to build a new Medicare urgent care clinic in the region to take pressure of the hospital\u2019s emergency department. \n  \n Updated at 3.50am BST \n \n \n  3.09am BST  \n  \n  Voting for Dutton is voting for higher taxes \u2013 Leigh \n  Finally, Leigh also argues that a vote for Peter Dutton is a vote for higher taxes (as the PM and Treasurer have also been pushing): \n   \n   Peter Dutton has pledged to repeal Labor\u2019s tax cuts \u2013 the very ones that deliver for the middle of the income distribution. If that happens, every Australian taxpayer will face a higher tax bill. These aren\u2019t theoretical risks. They are practical, immediate consequences \u2013 and they fall hardest on the people who deserve relief the most. \n   It would be, quite literally, the first time in living memory that a federal opposition promised to raise taxes on everyone. \n   The reforms we\u2019ve introduced aren\u2019t ideological. They\u2019re practical. Measured. Grounded in evidence. And, perhaps most importantly, designed not just for the world we model, but for the one Australians wake up in each day. \n   Fair tax policy isn\u2019t just about getting the incentives right. It\u2019s about getting the priorities right. And this reform puts the middle of the income distribution back at the centre of the conversation. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.50am BST \n \n \n  3.05am BST  \n  \n  Continuing from our last post \u2026 \n  Leigh has also presented new analysis on how the tax cut will help women. He says: \n   \n   The majority of low- and middle-income earners in Australia are women. They\u2019re also more likely to be in part-time or casual work, and more affected by the interplay between tax, family payments, and childcare costs. \n   Under these changes, around 90% of women taxpayers \u2013 6.3 million women \u2013 will receive a larger tax cut than under Morrison\u2019s Missing Middle Model. For those women getting a larger tax cut, the average increase in their tax benefit is $1,181. That\u2019s not just a spreadsheet improvement. That\u2019s more money for rent, groceries, bills and maybe a bit left over at the end of the fortnight. \n   Treasury estimates that the combined effect of the tax cuts will increase total hours worked by about 1.3 million per week. 900,000 of those hours are expected to come from women. That\u2019s the equivalent of unlocking more than 20,000 full-time roles \u2013 empowering people to work more if they choose to. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.28am BST \n \n \n  3.04am BST  \n  \n  Andrew Leigh spruiks benefits of stage-three tax cut changes \n  The assistant minister for competition, charities &amp; treasury, Andrew Leigh, has made a case for how the government\u2019s stage-three tax cuts have made Australian society more equitable. \n  Speaking at Melbourne University\u2019s conference on Justice and the Tax Base in the 21st Century, Leigh said: \n   \n   The Albanese government has introduced three rounds of income tax cuts. Each has been guided by the belief that a just tax system should reward effort, support those doing it tough, and help grow the economy without eroding the social contract. \n   \n  Making the case for income tax, he said: \u201cWhen it works well, it makes the country stronger, fairer, and more cohesive.\u201d \n  He said Labor\u2019s changes to the stage-three tax cuts helped more middle- and lower-income Australians: \n   \n   The second and third rounds go further by lowering the first marginal rate \u2013 currently 16% for income between $18,201 and $45,000. \n   From 1 July 2026, it drops to 15%. From 1 July 2027, it drops again to 14% \u2013 the lowest this rate has been in more than 50 years. For context, the last time it was this low, the original Mad Max was in cinemas and ABBA was still touring. \n   These tax cuts are steady, deliberate, and designed to reinforce progressivity while boosting after-tax incomes in a fiscally responsible way. \n   Consider someone on average earnings \u2013 around $79,000. In 2026\u201327, they\u2019ll receive a new tax cut of $268, increasing to $536 from 2027\u201328. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.20am BST \n \n \n  2.48am BST  \n  \n  \u2018Today is a dark day in the global economy\u2019, says Chalmers  \n  Chalmers hasn\u2019t yet spoken on Peter Dutton\u2019s claims he could have achieved a better or different outcome, but he says now\u2019s not the time for Dutton\u2019s \u201chigher taxes\u201d and \u201clower wages\u201d. \n   \n   Peter Dutton\u2019s response to higher tariffs around the world is higher income taxes for every Australian worker \u2026 \n   Today is a dark day in the global economy. Australia has a plan to respond to this global economic uncertainty, the plan in the budget and the additional steps announced by the prime minister today. We are not uniquely impacted, but we are uniquely placed and we are well prepared for whatever comes at us from around the world. \n   \n  The government has continued to reiterate the point that all countries have been affected by these tariffs, and there have been no carve-outs or exemptions negotiated with the Trump administration. \n  \n Updated at 2.51am BST \n \n \n  2.44am BST  \n  \n  Chalmers asks Treasury department for new modelling on tariff impact \n  The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is also digging into the US\u2019 decision to apply sweeping tariffs and says he\u2019s asked the treasury department to update modelling on the impact these tariffs will have. \n  Chalmers says he\u2019ll release that modelling publicly. \n   \n   These escalating trade tensions, these tariffs announced by the Trump administration in Washington DC, are self-defeating, they are self-sabotaging, and in a time when there\u2019s not a lot of growth in the global economy \u2026 \n   We know that we won\u2019t be immune from these tariffs, even though the US is only about 5% of our export market. We know that Australia, like other countries, that we are not uniquely impacted by these tariffs, but we are uniquely placed and we are very well prepared. \n   \n  Chalmers, like the PM, says Australia will continue to diversify its trade portfolio, and not engage in \u201ca race to the bottom\u201d on tariffs. \n  \n Updated at 2.54am BST \n \n \n  2.35am BST  \n  \n  ABC announces \u2018gimmick-free\u2019 debate between Dutton and Albanese \n  The ABC will host the first free-to-air leaders\u2019 debate at 8pm on 16 April with Insiders host David Speers as moderator.The leaders, Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton, will make opening and closing statements and will have equal time to respond to questions. The topics and questions will be decided by the ABC. \n  Speers said: \n   \n   This will be a gimmick-free debate, focused on the major challenges facing Australia at a critical time, and where the two leaders stand \n   The aim is to give voters an opportunity to hear the Prime Minister and Opposition Leader discuss their competing visions for the country and genuinely debate each other. \n   My commitment is to give both leaders fair treatment and an opportunity to make their case. \n   \n  The debate will be broadcast live on the ABC and ABC iview, and will also be available across ABC Local Radio, Radio National, ABC News Radio and on the ABC listen app. \n  \n Updated at 2.43am BST \n \n \n  2.28am BST  \n  \n  The press plane following Albanese has just touched down in Newcastle.  \n  As soon as we have details on the prime minister\u2019s next stop, we\u2019ll let you know!  \n  \n \n \n  2.24am BST  \n Former PM says US tariff policy a \u2018blitzkrieg on globalisation\u2019 \n  \n  Former Australian prime minister Paul Keating has weighed into Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs announcement, calling it Trump\u2019s \u201cblitzkrieg on globalisation\u201d and saying it represents the \u201ceffective death knell of NATO\u201d. \n  Keating says Trump\u2019s \u201cneo-Munroeism\u201d shows the US will now only focus on the western hemisphere, and change the world\u2019s geo-strategic settings. \n  In a statement, he wrote: \n   \n   Trump\u2019s new economic fortress America, by its design, winds off its principal economic and strategic partner, Europe, leaving China as the sole promoter of free and open international trade\u2026 \n   The announcement represents the effective death knell of NATO, a severing that will inform all other allied relationships with America including Anzus with Australia. \n   \n  Keating warns if the announcement spells the end of Nato, then what will continue to underpin the Anzus treaty. \n   \n   Australia\u2019s clutch of Austral-Americans, that phalanx of American acolytes, must have choked on their breakfasts, as Donald Trump laid out his blitzkrieg on globalisation, with all its implications for the rupture of cooperation and goodwill among nations. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.30am BST \n \n \n  2.15am BST  \n  \n  A closer look at Dutton\u2019s claims about achiving different tariff outcome  \n  Peter Dutton very strongly implied there that he would have achieved a different and a better outcome than Anthony Albanese (and every other country in the world). \n  Several times over that press conference he said there could have been a better outcome: \n   \n   There is a deal to be done here if the prime minister had the strength of leadership and ability to do it. He hasn\u2019t even spoken about the defence element to the relationship. It\u2019s the most integral part of our relationship with the United States. We could have leveraged a better outcome if we\u2019d been speaking about this from January 20. \n   \n   \n   We have the ability to manage the economy, the ability to manage our national security needs and we have an ability to make sure that we can get a better deal for Australia, which is what we would do. \n   \n   \n   We\u2019re not trading anything away. We want to enhance the relationship and I believe we\u2019re the only alternative at this election that can achieve a better outcome. \n   \n  But Dutton would not lay out exactly how he would get that \u201cbetter outcome\u201d. \n  He said several times he wasn\u2019t willing to punish the US through our defence alliance, like pulling US troops out of the Northern Territory. Sky\u2019s Andrew Clennell accused Dutton of sounding as if he\u2019s \u201ckowtowing\u201d to the Trump administration by just offering more to the Americans. \n  He also said there could be a deal on critical minerals, when the government had previously tried that \u2013 only to be rejected by the Trump administration. \n  \n Updated at 2.18am BST \n \n \n  2.02am BST  \n  \n  Dutton\u2019s claims of achieving a different tariff outcome challenged \n  Reporters are asking Dutton what exactly he would put on the table to achieve a different outcome with the US. \n  Dutton highlights critical minerals as a bargaining chip, and accuses the PM of not having \u201cspoken a word about it\u201d. (Albanese and Farrell previously said after the first tariffs were put in place on aluminium and steel that they had tried to negotiate on critical minerals but the US administration hadn\u2019t accepted it.) \n  Dutton also says that he won\u2019t consider pulling on any of the levers of the Aukus agreement, or pulling US troops out of Darwin. \n   \n   We\u2019re not trading anything away. We want to enhance the relationship and I believe we\u2019re the only alternative at this election that can achieve a better outcome. \n   \n  But he also won\u2019t commit that as prime minister, he would have been able to get these tariffs removed. \n   \n   What I offer to the Australian people, my team offers stability and proven performance. We have the ability to manage the economy, the ability to manage our national security needs. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.14am BST \n \n \n  1.53am BST  \n  \n  On a different matter, Dutton is asked why after an interview yesterday his transcript was edited. \n  Dutton had joked about the noise made by the Collins class submarines, and he said \u201cyou can hear them rattling down the coast\u201d. \n  Dutton says that shouldn\u2019t have been edited out. \n   \n   I haven\u2019t seen the transcript. It shouldn\u2019t be edited out. It was a jovial conversation with Mick Molloy, as you would expect. I\u2019ve been very clear and if you look at the transcript, and what I\u2019ve said otherwise in relation to Collins class, they are best in class but they run out of work in the late 2030s, early 2040s, which is why the government\u2019s inability to provide the upgrade is an outrage. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.58am BST \n \n \n  1.51am BST  \n Coalition \u2018could have achieved a different outcome\u2019 on tariffs, suggests Dutton \n  \n  Dutton is asked about whether Australia sitting lowest on the lowest run of these tariffs for anyone in the globe is a victory. \n  The opposition leader replies that the PM didn\u2019t know about the tariffs until it was announced in the media. \n   \n   The prime minister didn\u2019t know anything about it. It was first made known to him when it was publicly announced. So that talks about the influence that the prime minister has in relation to this matter. \n   There needs to be proper negotiation and consultation. 10% is a significant impost and it may not be the 26% that other countries have faced but I can tell you this. Jobs will be lost and there will be economic detriment to our country. \n   \n  Would Dutton have been able to produce a different outcome? \n   \n   I do believe that we could have achieved a different outcome. \n   \n  This would be the only better deal of all countries in the world \u2013 no countries were given an exemption. \n  \n Updated at 2.03am BST \n \n \n  1.44am BST  \n  \n  Dutton \u2018strongly supports\u2019 government\u2019s tariff response \n  The Coalition supports the five measures the government has announced in response to the tariffs, but there are some caveats. \n  Dutton says he \u201cstrongly supports\u201d strengthening the anti-dumping commission, and the $50m to help industries export to new markets. \n  He also strongly supports the government\u2019s buy Australia plan, and prioritising Australian products and industries for government procurement. \n  Dutton says they also support the $1bn economic resilience program but said it should be administered through the export finance Australia organisation, and not the national reconstruction fund. \n  The coalition also says \u201cthere\u2019s an arrangement to be arrived at\u201d on establishing a strategic reserve of critical minerals. \n  Dutton says: \n   \n   We\u2019ve been working on this but it is something the government can resolve, I think, very quickly, with the administration. We need to do that for our beef producers and for every industry here and to protect jobs in Australia, we need this sorted out as quickly as possible and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re dedicated to do. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.17am BST \n \n \n  1.37am BST  \n  \n  Dutton calls on Albanese to \u2018get the relationship normalised\u2019 with US \n  Dutton believes a deal can be \u201cdone very quickly\u201d and says the PM must do everything he can to do that. \n  Albanese said earlier that there have been ongoing discussions and negotiations with the US administration. \n  Dutton reiterates his point that the PM hasn\u2019t been able to speak to Trump again. \n   \n   We have an opportunity \u2026 to start negotiations with the United States straight away. I think there can be a deal done very quickly with the administration and I think it\u2019s important the prime minister apply himself to that immediately. \n   The prime minister hasn\u2019t been able to get a call or a meeting with president Trump, but that needs to change and he needs to do everything he can to leverage the ambassador and others to get the relationship normalised. \n   It\u2019s obvious that the prime minister didn\u2019t know anything about this announcement until it was actually released to the press. \n   \n  Dutton says Australia has the Aukus deal and the Anzus treaty, as well as stores of critical minerals, which are a \u201cnatural point of leverage\u201d in the relationship with the US. \n  \n Updated at 1.44am BST \n \n \n  1.33am BST  \n  \n  \u2018This is a bad day\u2019 for Australia, says Dutton.  \n  Peter Dutton is responding to the tariff announcement, speaking this morning from Perth. \n  Dutton says he\u2019s spoken to beef producers this morning, and says they\u2019re in negotiations with their counterparts in the US. \n   \n   I think this is a bad day for our country and it\u2019s not the treatment that Australians deserve, because we have a very trusted, longstanding and abiding relationship with the United States. \n   I want to make sure that we can help our beef-producers, make sure that we can help our manufacturers, grow our industry and increase employment in this country and we can do that through a normalised relationship in a trading sense with the United States and obviously to expand other markets, which is exactly what a Coalition government does. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.36am BST \n \n \n  1.30am BST  \n  \n  Dutton about to speak to reporters in Perth \n  The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is due to front the media any minute now to respond to this morning\u2019s tariff announcements.

It needs to be treated just as seriously. \n   Biosecurity is the first line of defense against extinctions and ecological destruction caused by new invaders. It is cheap compared to mopping up the mess if we let these things arrive. \n   \n  At his press conference earlier this morning, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said Australia had made it \u201cvery clear\u201d to the United States \u201cthat we will not compromise on biosecurity.\u201d \n   \n   We will not weaken the measures that protect our farmers and producers from the risks of disease or contamination. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.36am BST \n \n \n  1.20am BST  \n  \n  Pauline Hanson\u2019s daughter announces she will run for Senate \n  In some other political news this morning, Pauline Hanson\u2019s daughter, Lee Hanson, has announced she will run for the Senate in Tasmania in the upcoming federal election. \n  She will run as part of her mother\u2019s party, One Nation. Lee made the announcement on Sunrise earlier this morning. \n   \n   If you had asked me 10 years ago if I would be standing here right now, I would say absolutely not, no way! To your point, seeing what [Pauline has] been through, as a child witnessing your parent \u2013 the turmoils, ups and downs \u2013 why would you want to put yourself through that? \n   However, I\u2019m a mum myself now. So I\u2019m at a point where I feel I need to stand up. I care too much about my children\u2019s future, so it\u2019s time to make a change. \n   \n  Lee later said \u201cmy mother is polarising\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not gonna question that.\u201d \n   \n   My mother is polarising.

Here are the points in a bit more detail: \n   \n   The government will give $5m to the anti-dumping commission to reduce case times, and better monitor goods and high-risk activities from overseas. There were concerns from industry that tariffs could lead to some countries \u201cdumping\u201d cheap stock into Australia. \n   There\u2019s also $50m to help industries find new markets. \n   A new economic resilience program within the national reconstruction fund which will provide $1bn of zero interest loans to help industry access new markets. \n   Prioritise Australian firms in government procurement by requiring government to preference Australian businesses for procurement up to a threshold \u2013 including consideration of local content requirements for procurements above $1m. \n   Establish a critical minerals strategic reserve to underwrite critical mineral production and supply. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.26am BST \n \n \n  12.27am BST  \n  \n  Albanese: Norfolk Island not a trade competitor with \u2018giant economy\u2019 of the US \n  The first question goes straight to tariffs. \n  As Dan Jervis-Bardy (who\u2019s with the prime minister at this press conference) brought you earlier, it\u2019s been confirmed there will not be a ban on Australian beef, but the industry will be hit with the 10% tariffs. \n  Albanese says he\u2019s spoken to the national farmers federation and beef producers, to confirm the tariff impacts with them. \n   \n   All Australian supports are with them at this time and it is a really difficult period for them but it will be a 10% tariff. Brazil has the same so in terms of the competitive position, it is maintained. \n   \n  Of course the most shocking tariffs put in place are those on Norfolk Island \u2026 \n   \n   Norfolk Island has got a 29% tariff.

Without this PBS subsidy, families could be up for up to $178,000 a year. As a result of this decision, when they come into pharmacies like this, the cost will be just $25 per prescription, making an enormous difference. \n   \n  The health minister, Mark Butler, says a medicine to help treat bone marrow cancer has also been added: \n   \n   1,900 patients a year who would otherwise be paying $70,000 on the private market for this life changing, life-saving treatment for this rare form of bone marrow cancer. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.24am BST \n \n \n  12.17am BST  \n Stock market stumbles after Trump tariff announcement \n  \n  Investors are being \u201cliberated\u201d of billions of dollars, as sharemarkets begin to tumble after the unveiling of Trump\u2019s sweep of new tariffs. \n  In early trade this morning, the benchmark ASX 200 index has dropped by 1.8% to 7794 points. \n  That follows US stock futures plunging by more than 3% as investors priced in the rising chance of a global trade war, Bloomberg is reporting. \n  Sticking with Wall Street, the likes of Nike, Gap and Lululemon cratered by more than 7% \u2013 a strong sign that the 10% blanket tariffs \u2013 and much larger imposts on Japan, the EU and, especially, China \u2013 will not do the global retailers any favours. \n  \n Updated at 1.19am BST \n \n \n  12.05am BST  \n  \n  The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, says Australia should \u201cend Aukus\u201d in response to Donald Trump\u2019s latest tariffs. \n  In a series of posts to X (formerly Twitter), Bandt wrote: \n   \n   End Aukus. \n   Forget Trump\u2019s \u2018Liberation Day\u2019, today should be Australia\u2019s liberation day \u2014 when we finally liberate ourselves from being shackled too closely to Trump. \n   Trump is dangerous.

Speaking outside parliament this morning, she said: \n   \n   They\u2019re unjustifiable, particularly when you consider the impact they are going to have on working people, not just around Victoria or Australia, but around the globe. These sorts of measures only put more pressure on working people, on their families and on their jobs. \n   \n  She says Victoria is the \u201cfood bowl of the nation\u201d and was important to protect the state\u2019s biosecurity: \n   \n   We are known internationally for our clean, green reputation for exporting to the world high-quality produce. So I strongly support the prime minister\u2019s emphasis on ensuring those biosecurity arrangements remain strong. \n   \n  Allan also said she would continue to push local content requirements for Victorian transport projects and revealed she met with defence manufacturer Lockheed Martin last week to put the state\u2019s businesses at the \u201cfront of the queue in the supply chain\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 12.17am BST \n \n \n  11.54pm BST  \n  \n  Australia\u2019s red meat industry will remain \u2018strong\u2019 despite tariffs, says advisory council  \n  The Red Meat Advisory Council (RMAC) says it\u2019s \u201cdisappointed\u201d of tariffs on red meat exports to the US, but noted there will be no ban on Australian red meat and that trade with the US will continue. \n  The council says the decision fails to recognise the industry\u2019s contribution to US food supplies, but also pointed out how diverse the trade market is, particularly across Asia. \n  The RMAC Chair, John McKillop, says producers can be \u201cassured\u201d the industry will continue to operate in a \u201cstrong global trading environment\u201d. \n   \n   It remains a disappointing decision from the US, in stark contrast to our 20-year partnership under the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement \u2026 \n   Last year, 2024, was a record year for Australian red meat exports, driven by strong global demand. Australian producers can be assured that we operate in a strong global trading environment with high demand for our red meat from over 100 markets. \n   Major markets include Greater China, Japan and Korea, worth $3.9bn, $2.6bn and $2.5bn respectively.

But we already take frozen beef, we already made concessions. \n   \n  Littleproud also says Australia should reengage with partners within the trans-pacific partnership (CPTPP). \n  \n Updated at 12.03am BST \n \n \n  11.44pm BST  \n  \n  Littleproud blames PM\u2019s \u2018disparaging comments\u2019 on Trump for tariffs on Australia \n  The Nationals leader and shadow agriculture minister, David Littleproud, says there\u2019s \u201cdeep disappointment\u201d over the tariffs, and that there\u2019s a need for a \u201crelationship reset\u201d. \n  He\u2019s putting some of the blame on the prime minister and government for having made disparaging comments of Trump in the past. \n   \n   What we need is a relationship reset. We\u2019ve got a prime minister who can\u2019t even get a phone call with the president. That\u2019s because of the personal disparaging comments he made in the past. We need a reset to explain to President Trump, when you look at the tariffs he imposed on beef, he\u2019s imposing that cost on his own people. \n   \n  Littleproud adds, specifically on beef, that Australia already takes US frozen beef, and that Australia shouldn\u2019t reduce biosecurity standards to allow other beef imports from the US. \n  \n Updated at 12.26am BST \n \n \n  11.40pm BST  \n  \n  Dutton says some ABC journalists are \u2018good\u2019 while others are \u2018partisan players\u2019 \n  Dutton was also challenged on 2GB to name a journalist at the ABC who he thinks does \u201ca good job\u201d, as he leaves the door open to cutting the public broadcaster\u2019s funding. \n  He initially skirts the question and says families and small businesses are struggling. \n   \n   Nobody at the ABC gets $1 of pay without you being funded by Australian taxpayers. And as I\u2019ve said before, if we find waste in the ABC then we won\u2019t support that, and Australian households and businesses would expect nothing less. \n   \n  Host Ben Fordham tries again \u2013 he mentions David Speers, Sarah Ferguson and Laura Tingle \u2026 Dutton answers that there are some \u201cpartisan players\u201d within the organisation. \n   \n   I think there are some good journalists at the ABC, but I think there are some who you know, who, frankly, are just partisan players. And people see that on their TV screens every night.

Dutton says he\u2019ll stand \u201cshoulder-to-shoulder\u201d with the government on rejecting the tariffs. \n  But he\u2019s again positioning his party as stronger in standing up to a Trump administration. \n  (Meanwhile, Albanese\u2019s and Wong\u2019s language this morning has been that Australia needs to react calmly and respond in a careful and calibrated way.) \n  Dutton tells 2GB: \n   \n   I happy to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the prime minister to make sure that we send a very clear message to the Americans that we don\u2019t find it acceptable at all, and we are a trusted, reliable trading partner with the United States. \n   But we need to have a capacity to stand up and to negotiate and to arrive at the best possible outcome for our country.

We\u2019ve governed in what have been turbulent economic times. \n   We have seen countries around the world with double digit inflation, some of them with double digit unemployment. At the same time across the ditch, New Zealand is in recession. What we have managed to do is negotiate our way through those turbulent economic waters.

Albanese says the government won\u2019t do that because it\u2019s not in Australia\u2019s interests. \n   \n   We believe that Aukus is in the interests of defending our nation. We think it\u2019s in Australia\u2019s interest, and whilst we regard this [tariffs] as an act of self harm by the United States when it comes to their economy, what I\u2019m not prepared to do is do anything that is in not in Australia\u2019s interests. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.39pm BST \n \n \n  11.18pm BST  \n  \n  PM says Norfolk Island hit with 29% tariff despite being an Australian territory \n  The PM is now on ABC Radio Melbourne, and is asked to clarify whether the action on beef is an all out ban or a tariff. \n  Albanese says his understanding is that it\u2019s a tariff. \n   \n   We\u2019ve been advised by their trade people that it\u2019s a 10% tariff. \n   I\u2019ve indicated very clearly in the discussions that I\u2019ve had with President Trump that we regard tariffs as not being in the interests of the United States. \n   \n  It seems that while the government did expect these new tariffs, it was somewhat taken aback by other tariffs for Norfolk Island, which is an Australian territory. \n  Albanese says: \n   \n   I think Norfolk Island somehow has been hit with 29% tariff rather than 10%. Last time I looked, Norfolk Island was a part of Australia. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.37pm BST \n \n \n  11.03pm BST  \n  \n  Where does the 10% number come from? \n  Anthony Albanese says the 10% figure was a political decision and rather than an economic decision. \n   \n   They have made a decision that there will be a 10% tariff minimum from every nation. That\u2019s a political decision. This is not an economic decision.  \n   \n  He says the government is still seeking clarification on all the decisions, including on beef, which Albanese says has been discussed with the administration (though again he has stressed there will be no compromise on bio-security laws). \n  Back to his meeting with Greg Norman, Albanese won\u2019t say what advice Norman gave him, but that Norman and others will support their efforts to engage in the US. \n   \n   He\u2019s [Norman is] someone with connections with the US administration, and we are engaging with Australians who have connections with the United States to advance our national interests. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.13pm BST \n \n \n  10.55pm BST  \n Albanese says government using \u2018every asset\u2019 available in talks with US \n  \n  Anthony Albanese\u2019s provided a bit more detail on the conversations that the government has had with the US administration over the last few days before the announcement. \n  He said earlier that this decision from Donald Trump was expected, and discussions have been ongoing. \n   \n   There\u2019s been a series of written to and fro, if you like. There\u2019s been negotiations with Mr [Howard] Ludnick [the commerce secretary] and with others in the United States as well. So this came as no surprise to us. \n   We had prepared for a period of time the response, a five point response that you will you announced this morning. We met as leaders last night, and again, had contact this morning with obviously, the relevant ministers, as well as our economic ministers. \n   \n  Albanese won\u2019t specifically say when his government was told Australia would be hit with tariffs, just that \u201cwe were very clear about where this was headed\u201d. \n  He adds the government is using \u201cevery asset\u201d available, and mentions his dinner with Greg Norman last night. \n  \n Updated at 11.09pm BST \n \n \n  10.49pm BST  \n Farrell vows to get free trade agreement with EU: \u2018The world has changed for Europe\u2019 \n  \n  Don Farrell says he believes the EU will come back to Australia with a better deal because the world has changed today and the EU has been hit even harder than Australia on its exports. \n  The trade minister says beef was one of the sticking points between the two regions: \n   \n   The agreement with the European Union did fall over, over beef imports into the EU. The world has changed. As of today, the world has changed for Europe. \n   Europe has now [been] set back to a much higher tariff into the United States. If they\u2019re sensible, if they\u2019re sensible, they will make us a better offer on the issues that made the agreement fall over last time, and we will get a free trade agreement with the with the EU, the largest economy in the world. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.58pm BST \n \n \n  10.44pm BST  \n Albanese says \u2018no one has got a better deal\u2019 than Australia in Trump's tariff regime \n  \n  Anthony Albanese emphasises that \u201cno one has got a better deal\u201d than Australia, and diplomats and officials are continuing to engage with the administration: \n   \n   We have made very strong representations. Ministers, our ambassador, people in the embassy, people at departmental level, we\u2019ve used every asset at our disposal. \n   But what it does mean - it\u2019s a bit like what I was saying yesterday. Steel and aluminium, there\u2019s not more steel and aluminium being produced in the United States today than there was in February. \n   \n  The PM says that his understanding is that these 10% tariffs will be across the board. \n   \n   Australia and the United Kingdom were in negotiations, I\u2019m not sure about other countries, but I know that we were and that was under consideration \u2026 So our understanding is that it applies across the board. \n   \n  He says again the best response is to buy Australian, and Labor will continue to promote Australian products (like Bundaberg ginger beer which he says he had at the Bundaberg factory when he was up campaigning in Queensland earlier this week). \n  \n Updated at 11.34pm BST \n \n \n  10.39pm BST  \n Farrell to meet with European counterparts to discuss FTA \n  \n  The trade minister, Don Farrell, says Australia will continue to engage with the US administration to remove the \u201cunfair\u201d tariffs. \n  He reiterates the calm approach, saying it will be by negotiation, by \u201csitting down and explaining to people the issues at hand\u201d that will best present Australia\u2019s case. \n  Farrell has also revealed he\u2019s meeting again with he\u2019s European counterparts to re-discuss a free trade agreement with the EU (previous negotiations got stuck on issues like naming rights for products including feta and prosecco). \n   \n   On that Monday afternoon, I\u2019m talking with my European counterpart, we all know what happened the last time we had discussions with the Europeans, I think things have changed. And the opportunity to have further negotiations about a free trade agreement on better terms than have been previously offered now exists. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.53pm BST \n \n \n  10.36pm BST  \n  \n  Wong says countries in Asia-Pacific region hit hard by tariffs \n  Penny Wong stands up next and says the decision from the US underlines the current state of global uncertainty. \n  Wong goes further in outlining how Australia is diversifying its trade, and will continue to focus on trade in our region, and across South-East Asia. The foreign minister says: \n   \n   Some of the countries in our region are the hardest hit by the tariffs.  \n   But we face those challenges calmly and maturely. We certainly won\u2019t be picking fights in our neighbourhood. Our approach is to be credible and mature. \n   \n  Yesterday Peter Dutton said he would be prepared to fight with the US administration over these tariffs. \n  So we\u2019re getting a clearer divide in approach between the two major parties \u2013 Labor emphasising a calm and methodical approach, while the Coalition is going more aggressive, and trying to pin that calm approach as \u201cweak\u201d (which we heard again from Dutton this morning). \n  \n Updated at 10.52pm BST \n \n \n  10.31pm BST  \n Albanese announces funding to help exporters move into new markets \n  \n  In response to the tariffs, and concerns on the global impacts, Albanese says the government will tighten anti-dumping measures to safeguard the aluminium and steel industry (hit by the first round of tariffs). \n  He\u2019s also announced $50m to help the agricultural and other sectors to move their products into new markets. \n  There will also be a new critical minerals strategic reserve \u2013 but the PM says more details on that will be revealed later. \n   \n   We will establish a new economic resilience program through our National Reconstruction Fund. This will provide $1 billion in zero-interest loans for firms to capitalise on new export opportunities\u2026 \n   Just as we are already encouraging more people to buy Australian, our Labor government will buy Australian, too. This comes on the back of the announcements that I made in Port Kembla, for example, about procurement of Australian steel. \n   \n  Albanese says Australian businesses will get priority, and sit at the front of the queue for government procurement. \n  \n Updated at 11.01pm BST \n \n \n  10.28pm BST  \n  \n  Albanese: \u2018This will have consequences for how Australians see this relationship\u2019 \n  Anthony Albanese says the government will stand up for Australia\u2019s interests. \n  Interestingly, the PM says the action will have \u201cconsequences for how Australians see this relationship\u201d between the US and Australia. \n   \n   The Australian people have every right to view this action by the Trump administration as undermining our free and fair trading relationship and counter to the shared values that have always been at the heart of our two nations\u2019 longstanding friendship. This will have consequences for how Australians see this relationship. \n   \n  Albanese says again there\u2019ll be no compromise on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or agriculture. \n   \n   We\u2019ll never trade away the things which make us the best country in the world. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is an Australian institution. A proud Labor creation that my government has built on. \n   We have made it very clear to the United States that we will not compromise on biosecurity. We will not weaken the measures that protect our farmers and producers from the risks of disease or contamination. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.37pm BST \n \n \n  10.24pm BST  \n Albanese says 'this is not the act of a friend' after Trump announcement \n  \n  Anthony Albanese says the latest action from the Trump administration has not come as a surprise, and the tariffs are \u201cnot unexpected\u201d. \n  But he repeats the line that the tariffs are unwarranted: \n   \n   President Trump referred to reciprocal tariffs. A reciprocal tariff would be zero, not 10%. The administration\u2019s tariffs have no basis in logic and they go against the basis of our two nations\u2019 partnership. This is not the act of a friend. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.04pm BST \n \n \n  10.23pm BST  \n Peter Dutton: \u2018We need to stand up for our country\u2019s interests\u2019 \n  \n  Just before the PM stands up, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is reacting to Trump\u2019s announcement, speaking to 2GB radio. \n  Dutton says Trump\u2019s put forward a negotiating position, but says there\u2019s been \u201cno significant negotiation\u201d between US and Australian leaders, as Albanese hasn\u2019t been able to get Trump on the phone for a third call. \n   \n   So there has been the significant failing, and we need to be strong and to stand up for our country\u2019s interests. \n   \n  Dutton is going in hard saying, saying \u201cwe need to stand up for our country\u2019s interests\u201d. \n   \n   Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have any time for [ambassador] Kevin Rudd, and we know that Anthony Albanese is on the record saying all sorts of colourful things about the president. Well, it\u2019s obviously a dysfunctional relationship, and we need to make sure that we stand up for our country\u2019s interests, and the prime minister, as I say, can\u2019t get a phone call, can\u2019t get a meeting, and I hope that that happens soon, because it\u2019s in our country\u2019s best interest. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.27pm BST \n \n \n  10.16pm BST  \n  \n  The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, the foreign minister, Penny Wong, and the trade minister, Don Farrell, will respond to Trump\u2019s tariffs at 8.20am.

He also says the PM should be speaking to Trump face to face. \n   \n   I think the most important thing is the direct relationship that we have and are able to build on with the President and with our other friends in the United States. And I do think it would exist in achieving that for having direct face to face talks between the Australian Prime Minister and the American president. \n   Just hoping for an exemption is not a plan, and just leaving this to officials is not adequate. And I think we do need strong leadership to deal with this. \n   \n  The PM met with Greg Norman overnight, who has a close relationship with Trump. \n  \n Updated at 10.18pm BST \n \n \n  9.46pm BST  \n  \n  Albanese to respond to Trump\u2019s tariff announcement \n  The press pack following Anthony Albanese has arrived at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Offices (CPO) in Melbourne\u2019s CBD, where the prime minister will soon respond to Trump\u2019s tariffs announcement. \n  \n Updated at 9.51pm BST \n \n \n  9.42pm BST  \n Australia to be hit with 10% reciprocal tariff from US, chart shows \n  \n  We have seen the full chart that Donald Trump was holding earlier. \n  Trump mentioned there would be a minimum 10% reciprocal tariff, and according to that full chart, Australia will incur the 10% reciprocal tariff. \n  Anthony Albanese is due to speak soon this morning, and will respond to Trump\u2019s announcement. \n  This week he said there would be no negotiations with the US over changing the PBS, bio-security laws or the news bargaining agreement. \n  \n Updated at 10.09pm BST \n \n \n  9.38pm BST  \n  \n  Trump has moved on to the possibility of exemptions \u2026 \n  In Trump\u2019s first administration, Australia secured exemptions from tariffs after arguing that Australia ran a trade deficit with America, had a signed and ratified free trade agreement, and was a committed ally and security partner. \n  But Trump\u2019s second administration has repeatedly said the president regrets the exemptions he gave to Australia in his first term, particularly for the precedent they set for other countries claiming similar carve-outs. \n  He said this morning: \n   \n   To all of the foreign presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens, ambassadors, and everyone else, who will soon be calling to ask for exemptions from these tariffs, I say: terminate your own tariffs, drop your barriers, don\u2019t manipulate your currencies \u2026 and start buying tens of billions of dollars of American goods. \n   \n  \n Updated at 9.53pm BST \n \n \n  9.33pm BST  \n  \n  Trump says tariffs to be placed on pharmaceuticals \n  Trump says he\u2019ll be putting in place reciprocal tariffs on pharmaceuticals, at half the rate \u201cthey have been charging us\u201d. \n  Trump calls it a discounted reciprocal tariff, rather than a \u201cfull reciprocal\u201d which he says would have been \u201ctough\u201d for a lot of countries. \n  He\u2019s got a print out chart and is going down a list of individual tariffs for countries including China, Vietnam, the UK, Switzerland and more. \n  Australia hasn\u2019t been mentioned down the list (he didn\u2019t read the whole thing) but Trump says there will be a minimum reciprocal tariff of 10%. \n  \n Updated at 9.37pm BST \n \n \n  9.21pm BST  \n Trump confirms Australian beef on tariff menu \n  \n  Australia has gotten its first mention \u2013 Trump says Australia has banned American beef, but the US imports $3bn of Australian beef. \n  The ban on US beef was imposed in 2003 after America cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease). \n  He hasn\u2019t yet said what penalty will apply: \n   \n   Australia \u2026 they\u2019re wonderful people, and wonderful everything, but they ban American beef. Yet we imported $3bn of Australian beef from them just last year alone. They won\u2019t take any of our beef. They don\u2019t want it because they don\u2019t want it to affect their farmers and, you know, I don\u2019t blame them but we\u2019re doing the same thing, right now starting at midnight tonight, I would say. \n   \n  Beef is a significant Australian export to America \u2013 Australian lean beef is added to fatty American meat to make hamburgers. \n  \n Updated at 12.33am BST \n \n \n  9.10pm BST  \n Trump hails \u2018the day America\u2019s destiny was reclaimed\u2019 in tariff announcement \n  \n  Donald Trump has stepped into the rose garden at the White House and declared \u201cliberation day\u201d will make America wealthy again. \n  The US president is announcing reciprocal tariffs. \u201cThat means they do it to us and we do it to them. Simple.\u201d \n   \n   April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America\u2019s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again. \n   For decades our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike. \n   \n  Trump claims the tariffs will bring jobs and factories back to the US. \n   \n   This will be indeed the golden age of America. \n   \n  You can follow our US politics blog here for all the updates from Trump\u2019s announcement. \n  \n Updated at 9.40pm BST \n \n \n  9.04pm BST  \n Labor's 'same job, same pay' laws will deliver $920m pay rise for workers, study says \n  \n  The Albanese government\u2019s \u201csame job, same pay\u201d laws will deliver a combined $920m annual pay rise for workers, according to new analysis that Labor will use to warn of the risks to wages if Peter Dutton rolls back the regime. \n  Laws came into force last year allowing labour-hire workers to apply to be paid the same amount as directly employed staff doing the same job. \n  Unions are already using the bargaining tool, with hundreds of Qantas flight attendants set to receive pay rises of up to $20,000 per year after the airline reached an agreement with the Flight Attendants\u2019 Association of Australia. \n  A new report from progressive think tank the McKell Institute estimated the new system would deliver a wages boost of up to $920.3m each year to workers in industries such as mining, aviation and retail. \n  The McKell Institute chief executive, Edward Kavanough, said: \n   \n   The data tells a clear story: the wage gains are real, they\u2019re substantial, and they\u2019re being delivered without any adverse impact on jobs or economic performance. \n   \n  The Coalition has promised to review the legislation as part of a wider rolling back of Labor\u2019s industrial relations agenda, which includes a promise to abolish the so-called \u201cright to disconnect\u201d. \n  The workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, claimed Dutton would scrap the laws in act of \u201cpure arrogance\u201d. \n   \n   This would rip billions of dollars out of workers\u2019 pay packets and the wider economy, particularly in regional Australia. \n   \n  \n \n \n  8.59pm BST  \n  \n  Good morning, \n  Krishani Dhanji here with you, thanks to Martin Farrer for getting us started this morning. \n  All eyes will be on the White House in a matter of moments, as Donald Trump unveils his latest, more wide-ranging set of tariffs. \n  There\u2019ll be plenty of reaction to it here and overseas throughout the day, and you\u2019ll no doubt see both Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton try to shape the issue to their advantage. \n  Buckle up, it\u2019s going to be a big one! \n  \n Updated at 9.27pm BST \n \n \n  8.56pm BST  \n John Howard says 'history is against' Coalition in election \n  \n  Former Liberal prime minister John Howard has labelled the Coalition as the underdog in the federal election, but said a volatile electorate and Anthony Albanese being \u201cout of his depth\u201d could hamper Labor. \n  Howard, speaking to Sky News\u2019 Chris Kenny on Wednesday night, said \u201chistory was against\u201d the Coalition winning the election, pointing out there hadn\u2019t been a one-term government in Australia since 1931. \n  Howard said: \n   \n   The electorate is more volatile, but you can\u2019t ignore history. I\u2019d have thought six months ago if we\u2019d have had this conversation, I\u2019d have thought the Coalition had no hope of winning simply because of history, but in the last six months, I think Peter Dutton has done a fantastic job. \n   The description I would make of the prime minister (Albanese) is that he\u2019s out of his depth. Now, I as a Liberal leader, I disagreed with Labor leaders a lot. I disagreed with Bob Hawke a lot, but I never thought Hawke was out of his depth, I just thought he was wrong. \n   I disagreed even more with Paul Keating, who I thought was inferior to Hawke as a prime minister, but you could never say he was out of his depth depth, whereas I don\u2019t think Anthony Albanese quite knows what\u2019s happening around him, particularly when it comes to Chinese ships, he doesn\u2019t seem to have a clue. \n   \n  Howard also backed the Coalition\u2019s proposed fuel excise cut over Labor\u2019s tax cuts unveiled at last week\u2019s budget, arguing the immediacy of impact of the excise cut will better address cost of living challenges. \n  The former PM also predicted that it would be harder than expected for teal MPs to retain their seats. He said: \n   \n   I think a lot of people who voted for the teals did so because they were grumpy for one or another reason with the Liberals. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case now. I think they like Dutton. \n   I think they see in Dutton an unexpectedly strong, serious leader. He\u2019s a serious player, and he gives the impression of somebody who\u2019s been around. He\u2019s not full of himself and does understand the good and the bad in society. \n   \n  \n Updated at 9.22pm BST \n \n \n  8.52pm BST  \n  \n  Peter Dutton to WA visit to promise road funding to support mining \n  Peter Dutton is in Western Australia for his first visit to the mining state of this campaign, and has come bearing a $600m announcement for roads which are critical to mining and agriculture. \n  He will spend the day in WA and Perth, before it\u2019s expected he\u2019ll return to the east coast late tonight or early tomorrow. \n  The infrastructure pledge would be spent nationwide, but announcing the money in WA is intentional. In a statement, Dutton said \u201cWe appreciate the contribution that Western Australia in particular makes to Australia through the mining, resources and agricultural sectors.\u201d \n  \u201cWe know that WA\u2019s exports help pay for the nation\u2019s roads, hospitals and schools,\u201d he said. \n  The big money promise would, according to the Liberal leader, \u201csupport our mining, resources and farming sectors by investing in infrastructure to upgrade agricultural and mining roads critical to getting product to domestic and export markets.\u201d \n  \u201cThe Coalition will work with representatives of the trucking, farming and mining industries to identify the priority roads to be upgraded in each state to remove barriers to the growth of our resources and farming sectors.\u201d \n  The money would come over four years, and go toward sealing, widening and strengthening roads and bridges, as well as flood resilience upgrades. \n  \u201cI want Western Australia to continue to be the powerhouse of the national economy. But we need a government in Canberra that plays to WA\u2019s strengths, not works against it,\u201d Dutton said. \n  \n Updated at 9.14pm BST \n \n \n  8.45pm BST  \n Liberal candidate for Kooyong skips community forum to hit phones with Angus Taylor \n  \n  The Liberal candidate for Kooyong, Amelia Hamer, skipped a community forum dedicated to questions on climate policy on Wednesday night, opting instead to hit the phones with Angus Taylor. Text messages seen by Guardian Australia show Hamer was planning to hold a telephone conference call with Kooyong voters alongside the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, at 7:30pm. The community forum began at the same time. \n  This text message from \u201cVIC LIBERAL\u201d was sent to Kooyong residents at 7:15pm: \u201cAmelia Hamer here. I\u2019ll give you a call at 7:30 tonight. It\u2019s your chance to quiz me and the shadow treasurer about our plan to get Australia Back on Track.\u201d \n  Organisers of the Kooyong Community Forum, Lighter Footprints, told the audience that Hamer was a last minute cancellation and that as a result she would be represented by an empty chair: \n   \n   All candidates were made aware that if they were not coming tonight then they would be represented by an empty chair. This notice was given in advance. \n   \n  Lighter Footprints describes itself as \u201ca local climate group committed to leading effective climate action\u201d. The group described the event as a chance to \u201cfind out where the candidates stand on climate\u201d.In Hamer\u2019s place, the organisers asked a member of the Kooyong Climate Alliance, Alex Currell, to give an assessment of the Liberal\u2019s environmental policies: \n   \n   The Liberals have failed to announce a 2030 or 2035 emissions target, committing only to net zero by 2050. The fate of the climate will be determined by cumulative emissions, so this lack of short or medium term targets is deeply problematic. \n   \n  The event\u2019s presenter thanked Currell for \u201cstepping in last minute\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 9.12pm BST \n \n \n  8.38pm BST  \n PM dines with Greg Norman on eve of Trump's tariff announcement \n  \n  Anthony Albanese has revealed on social media that he met up with Greg Norman last night. \n  \u201cGreat to catch up with Greg Norman tonight in Melbourne,\u201d the PM wrote on Instagram, with a pic of the pair in white tops. \n  They reportedly had dinner together. \n           View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Anthony Albanese (@albomp)\"> \n   \n    Social media post from Anthony Albanese shows the PM with golfing great Greg Norman.\n    \n   \n  It\u2019s interesting timing, coming just hours before Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs were due to be announced. \n  Norman has previously been called on to act as a diplomatic bridge to the US administration, thanks to his occasional golf games with the president. \n  He reportedly helped connect then-PM Malcolm Turnbull and the president before Australia secured a tariff exemption. \n  Earlier this year Norman told the Australian Financial Review that he had played golf with Trump just before the recent election, and Trump had promised to give him US citizenship. \n  Albanese was also reported to have had a \u201cmissed call\u201d from Norman on Sunday morning, \n  \n Updated at 9.26pm BST \n \n \n  8.29pm BST  \n Welcome \n  \n  Good morning and welcome to our live election coverage. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the best of the overnight stories to get us into gear before Krishani Dhanji takes the wheel. \n  Former Liberal prime minister John Howard says Peter Dutton is the underdog in the federal election and that history favours Anthony Albanese because there hasn\u2019t been a one-term government since 1931. Speaking on Sky News last night, Howard said Dutton is taking the fight to Labor but he was up against it. However, he said \u201ca volatile electorate\u201d made things difficult to predict and he condemned Anthony Albanese as being \u201cout of his depth\u201d. More coming up. \n  Dutton will continue his \u201cunderdog\u201d fight when he takes his campaign to Western Australia for the first time today. He will announce a plan to spend $600m on roads across the country, hoping that the promise of federal spending on infrastructure will appeal to voters in a state where transport links are crucial for the dominant mining and agriculture sectors. \n  Anthony Albanese will be anxious to show he is not out of his depth and that he can stand up to Donald Trump if the US president\u2019s tariffs hit the Australian economy. There is concern that Trump\u2019s expected levies will hurt Australian pharmaceuticals, meat and metals among other things, and Albanese yesterday did not rule out the possibility of countering the tariffs by taking a case to the World Trade Organisation. \n  The PM revealed on social media that he dined with golfer Greg Norman last night. It\u2019s interesting timing, as Australia braces for Trump\u2019s \u201cliberation day\u201d tariffs. \n  We\u2019ll have all the political and market reaction to those tariffs as it happens. \n  \n Updated at 8.36pm BST \n"}
