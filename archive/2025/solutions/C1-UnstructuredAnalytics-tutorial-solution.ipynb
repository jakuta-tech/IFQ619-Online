The Bureau of Meteorology said the centre of the tropical low was expected to move inland more rapidly over Sunday while weakening. \\nMore than 330,000 homes and businesses were without power on Sunday morning. Residents in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales remained on watch for damaging floods and significant rainfall. \\nIn Queensland, the chief operating officer of Energex, Paul Jordan, has said the full restoration of power would take longer than a week. In NSW, Essential Energy, the state-owned electricity infrastructure provider, said debris – including fallen trees and vegetation – would have to be removed before power lines could be assessed and repaired. \\nOn Sunday the Queensland premier, David Crisafulli, said wind gusts of nearly 100km/h hit Toowoomba overnight. He said the state faced the risk of further rainfall leading to flooding on Sunday. \\n \\n  Related: Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred: tracking rainfall and wind speeds  \\n \\nRiver levels in Lismore’s CBD peaked at 9.31m on Saturday afternoon, below the height of the levee, and continued to fall slowly on Sunday.

Several watch and act warnings remained in place in south-east Queensland. \\nCrisafulli warned of continued challenges from localised flooding in Brisbane. Suburban creeks were overflowing on Sunday morning in a familiar pattern that in the past has been the forerunner to more serious flooding. \\nOn Sunday the Bureau of Meteorology said floodwatches in Queensland extended from the Mary River down to the border, including the South Coast creeks, the Logan, Albert River and westward to include the Condamine River and the MacIntyre River. Major flooding was expected for the Bremer River, Laurel Creek and the Logan River. \\nThe bureau warned residents in the NSW Northern Rivers region to expect further heavy rainfall on Sunday and into Monday morning that might lead to flash flooding, including in Lismore, Armidale, Tenterfield, Tamworth, Gunnedah, Moree, Narrabri, Casino and Kyogle. \\nWhat’s happening on the ground? \\nThe NSW State Emergency Service on Sunday said flooding and rainfall continued overnight, with further downpours expected on Sunday. The SES responded to 917 incidents in the 24-hour to 10am on Sunday. \\nMore than 14,000 people in NSW remain under weather warnings, with 36 emergency level, the NSW SES deputy commissioner, Damien Johnston, said. \\nHe said in the 24 hours to 10am on Sunday, the SES had responded to 17 incidents involving people driving through flood waters. \\n“Please adhere to the warnings,” he said. \\nJohnston said widespread rain will continue in NSW on Sunday and is expected to move over the tablelands to the north-west of the state.

       " 'How does ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred compare to past storms? [2025-03-08T19:12:06Z]': 'As ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred crossed the coast , authorities remain concerned about heavy rainfall and the potential for flooding. It is expected to make landfall in Queensland on Saturday as a tropical low. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, over the years, at least 20 cyclones have approached within 300km of south-east Queensland and northern NSW. Only a few have made landfall, but history shows that cyclones, and even ex-cyclones, have the potential to wreak havoc in this corner of the country.    Related: Albanese warns against complacency as Cyclone Alfred weakens to tropical low off Queensland coast    Dr Stephen Turton, an adjunct professor at Central Queensland University who has studied tropical cyclones for more than 30 years, said events in 1954 and 1974 caused extensive damage, in large part because of extensive rainfall and flooding.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email  Griffith University environmental historian, Dr Margaret Cook, said cyclones and tropical lows could cause “cascading disasters”, leading to flooding and other impacts, such as health problems and electricity outages.    In the aftermath of such storms, governments have tried to learn and better prepare for the future.  Here’s what has happened in the past – and how Alfred compares.  The Great Gold Coast Cyclone of 1954  An unnamed cyclone that crossed the coast at Coolangatta on 20 February 1954 brought such devastation it was dubbed ‘the Great Gold Coast Cyclone’. That was before the Bureau of Meteorology instituted its cyclone naming policy. It was also before the use of satellites, Turton said, which made the event difficult to confirm as a “true tropical cyclone”. Regardless, it caused a lot of damage. At least 26 people died and the cyclone caused widespread flooding and structural damage from Bundaberg to Grafton. Springbrook, about an hour’s drive inland from Coolangatta, recorded 900mm of rain in the 24-hours before the cyclone hit land, according to an account in the journal Climate Dynamics. Boats were reported in treetops at Beachmere, as the cyclone crossed the coast, bringing storm surges of 6.4 metres to Moreton Bay. About 200 metres of the Byron Bay jetty was swept away, taking with it the town’s entire fishing fleet.&nbsp; One of the worst hit areas was near Cudgen, a small coastal town in New South Wales, where houses were “blown apart and trees more than 1 metre in diameter were twisted out of the ground”. Flooding triggered by the cyclone swept across the northern rivers region, particularly affecting Lismore, Casino, Kyogle and Murwillumbah. The Courier Mail reported the first clear message from Lismore just after 5pm, after extreme rainfall caused record flood levels of 12.11 metres. “It has been a night of horror. We need help,” said a message broadcast on radio station 2LM. “More than 2,000 people are homeless. More than 1,000 are sheltering on high ground. We need 1,000 blankets tonight.” From Kyogle, later revealed as a “scene of devastation”, there was no word.   Related: Limited sleep, damp houses – and waiting for more wild weather: what it’s like on the ground as Alfred nears    Turton said while ex-tropical cyclone Alfred would bring heavy rainfall to similar areas, the human context today was totally different. “The Gold Coast in 1954 was nothing like it is today,” he said, adding that back then the area was made up mostly of smaller towns populated with beach shacks. Cyclone Dinah 1967  Cook, who specialises in climate-related disasters, said Dinah, a category three tropical cyclone which remained off the coast (making landfall at K’gari and then heading back out to sea) still did significant damage to the Gold Coast, which was by then starting to resemble the Surfers Paradise of today.&nbsp; Storm surges almost completely washed away the sand on the beaches. Waves crashed over the embankments and undermined the esplanade, causing parts to collapse, she said. Some buildings toppled into the sea. “It was a really big problem because they were worried about the tourism industry,” she said. “The beaches were off limits for a long time because there was just no sand.” Houses “were unroofed” at Bundaberg, Maryborough and along the Sunshine and Gold Coasts; the sea wall at Nudgee was destroyed, and homes were flooded with 0.66 metres of seawater. Data from the Insurance Council of Australia shows insurance losses were equivalent to $4.68bn. “Storm surges also affected the Gold Coast and water lapped the decking of the Jubilee Bridge, which is about 1.5 metres above highest astronomical tide.” Cyclone Wanda and ex-cyclone Zoe, in 1974  Cook said a series of cyclones hit a similar strip of coastline in 1974, beginning with Wanda, a category one cyclone that caused the “second biggest recorded floods since colonisation”. The ground was already wet and saturated when Wanda arrived on 24 January, crossing the coast at Maryborough, about 250km north of Brisbane. More than 500mm of rainfall fell on Brisbane within 24-hours, triggering the city’s worst floods since 1893. Sixteen people were killed in Brisbane and Ipswich. Thousands of homes were inundated; 56 in Brisbane were completely destroyed, and 41 were washed away in Ipswich, according to the Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience. Tom Mortlock, head of climate analytics for the Asia-Pacific at financial services group Aon and an adjunct fellow in the Climate Change Research Centre at UNSW, said Alfred was a reminder that tropical cyclones had the potential to track this far south, as Dinah had done. He said, Wanda, which followed a similar path to Alfred, was a good benchmark for what could occur, he said. “The difference then was that there wasn’t as much infrastructure and people as there are nowadays,” Mortlock said. The full impact and costs associated with Alfred won’t be known for some time, but he expects it could be a “multi-billion dollar event in terms of insured losses”. Ex-tropical cyclone Zoe followed just six weeks after Cyclone Wanda, crossing the coast at Coolangatta on 12 March 1974, then curving back out to sea.&nbsp; Wind damage from Zoe was limited, but flooding was extensive, and caused hundreds of evacuations in northern NSW, according to the bureau. It also caused landslides and severe erosion of Gold Coast beaches. The big legacy of the 1974 floods was the formation of Queensland’s State Emergency Service, Cook said, replacing what had previously been, something more akin to a “Dad’s army”.',\n",

Some people are still homeless. The trauma goes on and on. It is a community that has been for ever changed. \\n“I definitely still have flood trauma” says Gemma Martin, whose cottage was inundated. \\n“I didn’t think that I did, but if it rains heavily, I have flooding nightmares. It just happens. It’s floating around in the subconscious.” \\nAlfred could be worse. \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n“On Sunday” says the mayor of Tweed shire council, Chris Cherry, “when it was evident that this was going to be upon us I just kind of went ‘oh, no we can’t do this again. We can’t.’ But of course we can. And we will.” \\nThere’s no choice as Alfred bears down and moves closer to land. The cyclone is expected to arrive at 1am on Friday morning. And night-time is the worst for ferocious water and wind. In the dark of night is when the accidents happen. \\n \\n Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email \\n \\nOn Wednesday there is gentle, polite rain as the sky grows darker. The wind is eerie. It is hard to believe that within 48 hours we will be hit with a cyclone. Alfred is a different beast from the floods, which came after 90 days of continual rain, when the ground was saturated and the rivers engorged. The floods seemed to come out of nowhere. Alfred has announced himself, and he will bring cyclonic winds. \\n \\n  Related: ‘Prepare for the worst’: northern NSW warned Cyclone Alfred’s impact could rival devastating 2022 floods  \\n \\n“The thing that is unknown is the wind. We’re used to the rain here” says councillor Meredith Dennis, “but not the winds they’re predicting”. \\nJust as the floods were the biggest in history, Alfred is another historic event for this region. \\n“With a normal flood, I have got flood data going back to before 1954 so we can have an insight of what is going to happen once the rain starts falling,” says Chris Christo, an intelligence officer at the SES. \\n“With this one, it is 50 years since the last cyclone so we have no corresponding data to compare it against. We are a bit blind and have no idea until the rain starts falling in the catchment as to what we can anticipate. Like all floods it will start off as a minor flood, go to a moderate flood and to a major flood and we’ve just got to react as it happens. \\n“Our priority is saving lives, secondly property.” \\nChristo says that people are “hyperactive. They were here at first light filling sandbags. Everyone is proactive. The shopping centres are bare. A lot of people are contracting us to see what they should be doing. Some with some crazy ideas that we can build a 30 metre levee for them.” \\nDuring the floods, people were trapped in their houses as the water rose and rose. Now Denis says “people are scared, they are really scared. You can see people getting short tempered. They are stressed, it is not far on from the floods.” \\n“There is a lot of PTSD out there,” the president of volunteer resilience group CORE, Katrina Semple, says. \\nBut she says: “we will get through this. We’ve got great systems in place now so hopefully it will all be handled a lot better with the coordination of volunteers and jobs.” \\nThe residents know they will lose electricity and internet for an extended period of time. They know there will be flooding. For better or worse, they are experienced at this. All they can do now is prepare, brace and wait with dread. Move garden furniture inside, anything that could fly and hit someone’s house. Have food, candles, first aid kits ready. \\n“We have learned a lot from the floods” says Cherry. \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n“The best way we have found to help people in this situation is to help them be as prepared as possible this time. The council has done a lot of preparatory works in the last three yeas. We are making sure we have got equipment and staff deployed around the shire to be able to work on ensuring we have got water and sewer happening through the whole event. We have got new flood pumps that were only switched on last week.” \\nStill, it is going to be bad. Traffic is gridlocked in the main street, slowed down by horse floats as people move their animals to higher ground. \\nBut what this community has proven again and again is that they will pull together. They always have. \\nAfter the most recent floods came acts of kindness: volunteers who pulled off herculean tasks in helping others, hiking out into the hills to check on people who live under the radar. \\nIt has already started. An offer of a truck to move livestock for free, an offer to drive elderly people to safety. \\nAnd so Murwillumbah waits. \\nRead more of Guardian Australia’s Tropical Cyclone Alfred coverage: \\n \\n Tropical Cyclone Alfred LIVE: latest news and updates \\n When and where is Cyclone Alfred likely to make landfall? \\n Why did Tropical Cyclone Alfred slow down on its path towards the east coast? \\n What we know so far about TC Alfred \\n How to prepare for a cyclone \\n Brisbane flood map: suburbs at risk \\n Is climate change supercharging Tropical Cyclone Alfred as it powers towards Australia?  \\n',\n",

[2025-03-07T01:04:51Z]': 'Tropical Cyclone Alfred is due to hit south-east Queensland some time on Saturday morning, bringing the risk of destructive winds, extreme flooding and storm surges to millions of people around Brisbane, the Gold Coast and northern New South Wales.   Related: Cyclone Alfred live updates: Brisbane, Queensland and NSW BoM path tracking map; landfall time and category; weather forecasts TC Alfred rain and flooding warnings –\\xa0latest Australia news    After last year was recorded as the hottest on record around the world, and the hottest for Australia’s oceans, what role could the climate crisis be playing in Tropical Cyclone Alfred and its impacts?  What is climate change doing to cyclones?  Like all weather systems on the planet, tropical cyclones are forming in a world that is heating rapidly, mostly because of the burning of fossil fuels. The planet – and the world’s oceans – are retaining more of the sun’s energy because of the extra greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. But tropical cyclones are complex. They need ocean temperatures of at least 26.5C and the right setup of atmospheric conditions to form. In particular, they need low wind shear – that is, very little change in the wind, no matter how high they are blowing. Studies have found that global heating is expanding the tropical belt – the region where cyclones can form – and other scientists have found that, on average, the point at which cyclones achieve their maximum intensity has been shifting towards the poles. Dr Savin Chand is an expert on tropical cyclones and climate change in the Australian region. “Climate change isn’t causing tropical cyclones to form because they have been forming for millennia, but the environment in which they’re forming is becoming more hostile [to their formation],” the associate professor at Federation University said. “But when they do form, we know that sea surface temperatures that are their source of energy are much warmer now than they used to be.”   Related: Tropical Cyclone Alfred approaches the Queensland coast – in pictures    Chand has led research that has argued the number of tropical cyclones has fallen by 13% in the 20th century. This was in line with expectations from climate scientists that global heating could actually reduce the total number of cyclones that form – but, of those, there will be a shift to higher intensity systems. “These sea surface temperatures and warming in the atmosphere provide fuel to the systems so, when they do form, they have more energy to feed on and this tends to make them more intense than they used to be,” Chand said. How could climate change have affected Cyclone Alfred?  Cyclone Alfred formed in the Coral Sea towards the end of February when sea surface temperatures were almost 1C hotter than usual. The same area of low pressure and rising air known as a monsoon trough that birthed Cyclone Alfred actually spawned two other cyclones, Rae and Seru, which moved east, while Alfred took a path south-east and off the Queensland coastline. This year was the Coral Sea’s warmest summer on record.    Data from the Bureau of Meteorology shows ocean temperatures off Brisbane and to the south have been between 0.5C and 1C hotter than normal in recent days. On Tuesday, Tropical Cyclone Alfred was far enough south to come into contact with a weather system common at lower latitudes – an area of high pressure – that grabbed Tropical Cyclone Alfred and pushed it west towards the south-east Queensland coastline. On Wednesday, Cyclone Alfred was moving through this area as it approached the coast. It was expected to cross on Saturday morning as a category one system.   Related: Fallen trees, howling wind and drunken parrots: bracing for Alfred, I remember another Queensland cyclone   What is climate change doing to the impacts from cyclones?  There are three main impacts that scientists and authorities are concerned about from Tropical Cyclone Alfred’s move to the Queensland coast: damage from extreme winds, flooding from intense rain, and damage at the coast from storm surge and damaging waves. A warmer atmosphere can hold more water that can fall as rain and, generally, the atmosphere can hold 7% more moisture for each 1C of warming. But rainfall intensities can be greater than this because, as raindrops form, they also release energy into a system. Dr Andrew Dowdy, an associate professor and expert on tropical cyclones at the University of Melbourne, and his colleagues have advised that for Australia, infrastructure or building planners should consider that each degree of warming could increase rainfall by as much as 15%. Dowdy points to several characteristics from climate change that can make the impacts from Cyclone Alfred worse. “Climate change has heated the oceans so the dice [are] loaded for a greater chance of hot water around Australia, like what we saw this summer,” he said. “These hot ocean temperatures can help supercharge tropical cyclones with more extreme rainfall and flood risks.” When ocean heat up from climate change, they expand, pushing up sea levels. The melting of ice attached to land like ice sheets and glaciers also raises sea levels. Dowdy said sea levels around the globe had already risen by 20cm due to climate change, “which can make damages worse when storms like Cyclone Alfred hit”. “This includes more severe flood risks in tidal waterways like around the Gold Coast and the Brisbane River, as well as more severe coastal erosion.”  Read more of Guardian Australia’s Tropical Cyclone Alfred coverage:  Tropical Cyclone Alfred LIVE: latest news and updates When and where will the cyclone hit?

It can be helpful to have a plan of action ready, before the time comes. \\n \\n  Related: Why did Tropical Cyclone Alfred slow down on its destructive path towards Australia’s east coast?  \\n \\nFirst, be prepared to stay inside for a day or so, even after the wild weather has passed. You may have to manage without essential services for a while. And there are several important steps to take before venturing outside. \\nI have 20 years’ experience in disaster studies, including how communities can recover. Here’s what you need to know. \\nBefore you leave your safe room \\nSay you’ve chosen to “shelter in place”, in the safest room in the house. That’s the smallest room with the fewest windows – usually a bathroom, in a hall or a room under the stairs. \\nDo not leave this room until you have been told it’s safe to do so by authorities. Even after the storm has passed, the wind gusts can be very unpredictable. Depending on your location, flood water may still be a threat. \\nIf you still have access to the internet, check the digital disaster dashboard online. In Queensland, every council has their own disaster dashboard. New South Wales has the Hazards Near Me app. \\nTune into your local ABC radio station for official emergency updates, warnings and advice. Make sure you have spare batteries and even a backup AM-FM radio. Try to minimise use of your mobile phone to conserve battery power and network capacity. SMS/text messages are more likely to get through than phone calls. \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\nWhile you wait for normal services to resume \\nAfter the cyclone there may be no power, internet, mobile telephone reception or water supply to your home. This may persist for some time. \\nAhead of the cyclone, try to store enough drinking water to provide 3 litres per person for several days (don’t forget water for your pets). Store water in bottles in the freezer – it keeps it cool if the power goes out and can be drinking water when it melts. You also need extra water for hygiene, cleaning up and toileting. Fill your bathtub or top-loading washing machine with water before the storm approaches. \\nDuring a flood, sewage may come up through the toilet and the drains of dwellings on the ground level. Before the cyclone, cover your drains with plastic sheeting with a sandbag on top for weight. Place a plastic bag full of sand inside the toilet to form a plug and close the seat. Consider a bucket as a short-term option for toileting. \\nWait for flood waters to recede before unsealing the toilet. When the storm has passed, check local council advice on whether the sewerage system is functioning before attempting to flush the toilet again. \\nIf the power has been out, your fridge can remain cool; however, food inside may no longer be safe to eat. If items in your freezer have started to defrost, either cook immediately or dispose of them. Some medicines requiring refrigeration will also have to be thrown out. \\nDon’t use electric appliances if they are wet and check for any potential gas leaks from gas appliances before use. \\nContact your insurance provider immediately \\nIf you are likely to make an insurance claim, contact your insurer straight away for advice. \\nThe insurance company will probably ask for your policy number. Try to have it (and other important documents) on hand – perhaps in a waterproof wallet, or as photos on your phone. \\n \\n  Related: Fallen trees, howling wind and drunken parrots: bracing for Alfred, I remember another Queensland cyclone  \\n \\nDon’t go straight into cleanup and recovery mode until you have checked their requirements. Ripping up wet carpets and throwing out your belongings may not be consistent with your insurance policy. Disposing of proof of damage may cause your claim to be rejected. \\nApproaches vary between insurance companies. They may require photographs or a written inventory of damaged items. For instance, flood water will often leave a high-water mark on the walls. Take a photo with a ruler or bottle for reference. The more you can document, the less the insurance company can dispute. \\nBefore you head outside \\nDon’t leave your house until officials say it is safe to do so. \\nIf you have it, put on protective clothing and equipment, including fully covered shoes, gloves, glasses and an N95 mask. Wear a hat, long pants and long sleeves. \\nKeep your children and pets secure inside for as long as you can, until you know the area is safe and clear. \\nSwitch off your electricity, gas and solar system prior to severe weather. Before switching everything back on, check your house and appliances for any obvious damage. Then check with your utility service provider that all is in order. \\nEven if your house is without power, downed power lines may be live. Do not touch them, even if only wanting to move them. Call 000 if it is life threatening, or contact your local energy provider. \\nCheck for obvious structural damage to the house such as broken windows, water leaks or damaged roofs (such as missing tiles or screws). Beware of fallen or windswept debris and broken glass. \\nLook out for wildlife and pests, including venomous snakes and spiders. Don’t poke anything to check if it’s alive. \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\nBefore you start cleaning up \\nWear protective gear when dealing with water-damaged goods and mud. Don’t touch your face at all and if you can, wear a protective N95 mask. \\nThe mud and dirty water may be contaminated, so be sure to disinfect and wash your hands thoroughly. \\nIf you have cuts and scrapes, disinfect and cover them immediately, because there’s a high chance of infection. \\nFollowing floods in northern Queensland this year, 16 people died after being infected with melioidosis, a bacterium found in mud. The bug is more prevalent after heavy rainfall. If you feel unwell, seeking medical advice. \\nMould is another big issue after heavy rain and flooding. Open your windows to ventilate. \\nBefore you venture further afield \\nResist the urge to go sightseeing. Check on your neighbours and vulnerable community members instead. \\nTalk to friends, family, neighbours and contacts about how you’re feeling. Be honest. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious and upset after a disaster event. \\nIf you need extra assistance, seek help. Community recovery hubs will be set up and they will have a list of telephone numbers for support. Use the services available. \\nCheck your local disaster dashboard or app for up-to-date information on road closures, evacuation centres and other emergency details. \\n \\n Yetta Gurtner is an adjunct senior lecturer at the Centre for Disaster Studies, James Cook University, This article was originally published on the Conversation \\n \\nRead more of Guardian Australia’s Tropical Cyclone Alfred coverage: \\n \\n What we know so far about Cyclone Alfred \\n Why is it a big deal that Alfred could make landfall near Brisbane? \\n How to prepare for a cyclone \\n \\n \"> \\n',\n",

The bureau said most of the intense rainfall would occur to the south of where Alfred makes landfall. \\nBut tracking maps may change again over the coming days as the forecast evolves. \\n \\n  Related: When and where is Tropical Cyclone Alfred likely to hit? Here’s what you need to know  \\n \\nThe Queensland premier, David Crisafulli, said on Tuesday the “area of interest has narrowed” to a stretch of coastline that includes the Sunshine Coast, greater Brisbane and the Gold Coast. \\n“[That is] a largely populated area and we’re asking Queenslanders to stay on their guard,” Crisafulli said. \\n“The cyclone has firmed. All of the information does show this is something we need to take seriously. \\n“We’re asking a large part of the population, in a pretty big area, to be ready. There is still an element of the population that hasn’t yet fully understood the magnitude of this system. It’s been many decades since Queensland has been here. I know the people in the south-east might not have experienced a cyclone before.” \\n \\n Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email \\n \\nMore than 4 million people – from Grafton in New South Wales to K’gari in Queensland – remained on a formal “warning” footing by the bureau. \\nEarly on Tuesday morning, Alfred was 560km east of Brisbane and moving away, to the south-east, at about 6km/h. \\nBut forecasters said with increasing confidence they expected the system to undergo a “recurvature” by late Tuesday afternoon – a sudden change of direction – as it bumped up against another weather system to the south. \\n“Models are in agreement that the strengthening mid-level ridge to the south to steer Alfred westwards from later today,” the bureau’s technical bulletin from Tuesday morning said. \\n“Landfall location could range from the Sunshine Coast to the Gold Coast, and there is also uncertainty in terms of the timing of coastal crossing between late Thursday and Friday morning.” \\nThe update said the nature of the cyclone meant it was difficult to predict its intensity when it reaches landfall. \\nThere were three main causes of concern: surf conditions and coastal erosion; damaging winds; and potential flooding. \\nCrisafulli said the severity of the system and the timing of it crossing the coast would be critical. \\n“If it crosses at high tide, it makes it a far more challenging prospect,” he said \\nSue Oates from the Bureau of Meteorology said there was “total consensus” from seven global models that Alfred would head back towards the coast. \\nOates said strong winds – potentially more than 90km/h – could be recorded in coastal communities from Wednesday. There was also a significant risk of riverine flooding after predicted very intense rainfall. \\n“As Tropical Cyclone Alfred continues to move closer to the coast, rainfall will move further inland and become more intense, and we’re likely to see daily rainfall totals of around 200mm-plus, with isolated totals even higher than that, and up around 400mm is not out of the question,” Oates said. \\n“This will continue into Friday and looks like at this stage Saturday will still be significantly wet for south-east Queensland.” \\nIn the suburbs of the south-east, residents had begun preparations. \\nBrisbane had severely flooded three times in the past 15 years. Unlike parts of northern Queensland, locals do not typically prepare for the possibility of a cyclone. Many older “Queenslander” homes, an architectural feature of the area, were timber-built from the early 1900s. \\nThose risks have prompted authorities to issue clear early warnings. \\n“Early preparation can reduce damage and increase safety,” said Andrew Gissing, the chief executive of Natural Hazards Research Australia. \\n“Research … shows that often people do not understand what they need to do to be fully prepared. For example, research after the 2022 floods in Queensland and NSW found that 50% of residents acknowledged that they could have been more prepared.” \\nGissing said the primary hazards associated with cyclones were flooding, strong winds and coastal erosion, and that these occurring in a densely populated area were of “significant concern”. \\n“The damage that Alfred could lead to includes damages to homes, businesses and infrastructure; disruption to essential services and supply chains; agricultural losses; and injury and fatalities,” he said. \\n“Significant coastal damage can occur without a cyclone making landfall because of abnormally high tides and damaging surf.” \\nGissing said homes older than 1980 might not be built to building codes and could be at particular risk from strong winds. \\nRead more of Guardian Australia’s Tropical Cyclone Alfred coverage: \\n \\n When and where is Cyclone Alfred likely to hit? \\n Why is it a big deal that Alfred could make landfall near Brisbane? \\n How to prepare for a cyclone \\n',\n",

Promotion for this week’s opening round begins on Monday with a press conference in Sydney with AFL chief executive Andrew Dillon, along with players from the Swans, Giants, Hawthorn and Collingwood who are in action in first-round fixtures in New South Wales.   Related: AFL admits it has lost control of online gambling oversight amid spike in ‘integrity risks’    Sydney’s meeting with the Hawks on Friday may end up being the first match of the season if Alfred continues on its forecast path. AFL chief executive Andrew Dillon said his organisation would continue to be in communication with government and the Bureau of Meteorology in coming days. “We have contingencies, and there are options with byes and the like. But at the moment, the game is scheduled for Thursday night,” he said. The Lions and Cats both have a bye in round three, and the opening match could be shifted into that weekend if this week’s clash is postponed. An information bulletin issued by the BOM on Monday morning confirmed Alfred has strengthened to a category 2. Such a system making landfall would involve destructive winds and cause damage to houses, signs, trees and caravans with a risk of power failure, and with gusts above 125km/h. Dillon said the league’s priority is to keep fans and players safe. “With a potential cyclone, it’s the winds that are probably the biggest issue, we play in rain all the time but ultimately it’s what’s safe for our players and absolutely our fans as well,” Dillon said. The BOM’s latest bulletin warns “severe coastal hazards are likely for southern Queensland and northern New South Wales coasts” in coming days and that “landfall is most likely on Thursday or early Friday, with the favoured scenario placing it along the southeast Queensland or far northern New South Wales coast”.

When the wind is at its most ferocious, the trees in my garden are bent backwards. \\nThere is a silence where normally there would be birdsong. \\n \\n  Related: Cyclone Alfred live updates: Brisbane, Queensland and NSW BoM path tracking map; landfall time and category; weather forecasts TC Alfred rain and flooding warnings –&nbsp;latest Australia news  \\n \\nI have done everything I can to be ready for Cyclone Alfred, but can you ever be ready for a force of nature like this? \\nThe uncertainty of what is going to happen is stressing everyone out. My house is an old wooden house which was not built for cyclones. So far it is holding up, but it has never been tested like it is about to be. \\n \\n Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email \\n \\nThe waiting for something very bad is a mixture of denial and dread. \\nSusan Chenery – Murwillumbah, northern New South Wales \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n‘Will we have enough food, will we flood, will we have power?’ \\nThe wait is the worst. \\nThe winds are already gusting at gale force, the place is soaked, broken branches and other debris litter some areas and the beaches are beyond wrecked – but we’re still waiting. \\nFor some, taking the advice to bunker down at home until after Alfred has left the building is either already proving too tedious, or is simply being ignored. The pockets of the coast where it’s still – sort of – business as usual are doing a roaring trade. \\n \\n  Related: What we know so far about Tropical Cyclone Alfred: school closures, category now and suburbs at risk  \\n \\nOn Chevron Island, just over the river from what is now almost the ghost town of central Surfers Paradise, the normally quiet little local, the Chevron Tavern, is packed. The bloke behind the counter at the adjacent bottle shop reckons he has never had a busier day, and is struggling to find time to restock shelves and fridges. \\nBut we’re still waiting; waiting with a mix of anxiety bordering on impatience. Anxiety because no one knows just how bad things will get in the next 72 hours – will we have enough food, will we flood, will we have power (a redundant question for thousands of homes already blacked out), and will my house make it through intact? \\nAnd impatience because we’ve prepared as best we can – pantries stocked, candles and torches handy, loose objects secured and windows taped up to minimise the possibility of flying glass – and everyone wants the damn thing just to be over with. Which is probably why the few licensed premises still open look more like a sports bar on State of Origin night than a suburban pub on a rainswept Friday morning. \\nYes there are the inevitable idiots playing in killer waves and driving around sightseeing. For most of us though it’s like Waiting for Godot, but unlike the Beckett play, Alfred’s arrival is imminent. \\nPaul Syvret – Gold Coast \\n \\n  \\n  Techniques for taping windows have been popular, along with advice about where to obtain generators \\n   Royce Kurmelovs \\n   \\n  \\n \\n‘Has anybody checked the chicken nuggets?’ \\nWe were prepared for Tropical Cyclone Alfred until suddenly we weren’t. \\nBy Tuesday night everything was ready. Bins tied down, some of our rogue bamboo and tree branches hacked off. Anything remotely valuable shifted from under the house. Enough food to get us through until the weekend. \\nWe’ve done this twice before, when my partner and I were living in Darwin. We had a couple of hairy nights, but ultimately missed the worst. Tropical Cyclone Alessia came through as a tropical low system, and passed well south of Darwin. Severe Tropical Cyclone Nathan briefly seemed menacing but ultimately weakened well before reaching us. \\nWhen we left Darwin, we donated our unused cyclone kit to a friend. \\nThey tell you to plan for three days, but that’s trickier than it sounds when – within hours of learning that Alfred might head towards Brisbane – the supermarkets were stripped of bottled water and tins of beans. \\nWe’ve done what we can. Filled every water bottle in the house from the tap. Stocked up with food that would last us until Saturday. \\nBut on Thursday morning, a problem. We’d been expecting Alfred the following night. Now, the Bureau of Meteorology was predicting the tropical cyclone might be delayed 24 hours, or possibly longer. \\nDid we have enough supplies for an extra day or two? Has anybody checked the chicken nuggets? Shit! \\nThe scenario was unthinkable: spending the next few days locked up with the three-year-old equivalent of a tropical cyclone (and his older brother) without a sufficient supply of the only thing he will reliably eat. We had a day’s supply at best. Fortunately, our freezer is now stocked. We’re cooking a load ahead of time in case the power goes. \\nNeither of our kids seem to grasp what they’re in for. The wind is picking up and the rain is getting heavier. The five-year-old, otherwise obsessed with the weather, has been talking about “tornadoes”. He’s just asked for the shutter on the skylight to be closed. \\nBen Smee – Brisbane \\n‘It’s hard to stay still and do nothing’ \\nTree branches flying, horizontal rain coming in thick sheets, winds gusting so strong I’m thinking the windows might shatter inwards. \\nLooking at the big gum swinging back and forth over the house and hoping it has deep roots. Calculating where in the house might be safe so if it goes we won’t be crushed – possibly overdramatising it, but here in the northern rivers our trees haven’t been cyclone-tested. We have no internet, no power, which means little distraction from the anxiety of waiting for Alfred. \\nBut it also means I can no longer stare at the big spinning red and purple vortex hundreds of kilometres wide heading for the coast. \\nIt’s good to get a break from windy.com but we’re still very on edge, hoping that Alfred making landfall will bring some relief. \\nI’m between Byron bay and Bangalow, an area that understands big storms, but I haven’t seen anything like this. Or heard anything like this. I once stood in a sound booth at the museum and art gallery in Darwin to listen to a soundtrack of Cyclone Tracy and last night I was back in that booth. There wasn’t much sleep. But things could be much worse. Everyone in this region feels so deeply for our neighbours in Lismore, facing this again after the floods that devastated the community three years ago. It’s heartbreaking to think of what they are going through right now. It’s hard to stay still and do nothing. \\nLucy Clark – Bangalow, NSW north coast \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n‘For some, there is a sense of deja vu’ \\nThe northern rivers started early. As colleagues in Brisbane breezily reported the quiet before the storm, down here a state of emergency had already begun. \\nAs Cyclone Alfred lay offshore, wind whipped through the region on Wednesday and the power was cut to homes in the hinterland – including ours. It was restored that night but cut off after huge gusts throughout the night. \\nSince then trees have already fallen, flooding is beginning to cut roads. Amid wind and rain people have been making preparations. For those who still have access, Facebook groups have been a place for sharing tips and advice – with sometimes questionable degrees of accuracy. Techniques for taping windows have been popular, along with advice about where to obtain generators for those who can afford such luxuries. \\nFor some, there is a sense of deja vu. Three years ago, Lismore drowned in a non-cyclonic event and still hasn’t fully recovered. When an evacuation order went out on Thursday night for south Lismore, there was a collective sense of dread. A string of communities along the coast have since been told to evacuate, or are preparing to evacuate. And Alfie is yet to arrive. \\nRoyce Kurmelovs, northern rivers, NSW \\n‘Watching this reminds me of those dark few days in late February 2022’ \\nThree years ago, my apartment block was one of the thousands along the Brisbane River inundated by the floods that devastated south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. It was the second time I’d been displaced in a bit over a decade, and I was done. In the end, I left Brisbane entirely. I moved to Maleny, on the Sunshine Coast hinterland. \\n \\n  Related: When and where is Tropical Cyclone Alfred likely to hit? Here’s what you need to know  \\n \\nMaleny is about 500 metres above sea level. A woman threw me a look the other day when she asked me if I was prepared for Alfred. \\n“Well, I just question everything. That’s all I’ll say,” she said darkly. \\nI didn’t ask what, exactly, her question was. If I had, I’d have been there all day – and there were things to do. \\nWe’re as prepared as we need to be, but not too concerned, despite track maps showing the system is likely to pass closely. We’re on a creek, but high enough not to worry. Which is a good thing, because it’s a wet place: we had close to three and a half metres of rain last year. I’d rather be here than my old apartment block on the Brisbane River, though. \\nStill, watching this reminds me of those dark few days in late February 2022. You knew it was coming. And yet nothing could prepare you for the reality. \\nAndrew Stafford – Sunshine Coast \\nRead more of Guardian Australia’s Tropical Cyclone Alfred coverage: \\n \\n Tropical Cyclone Alfred LIVE: latest news and updates \\n When and where will the cyclone hit?

       " 'Bipartisan ‘sand army’ put political rivalries aside to distribute sandbags as Cyclone Alfred looms [2025-03-06T09:22:24Z]': 'Political rivalries have been put aside as Tropical Cyclone Alfred approaches and a wave of volunteers, including federal MPs, pitch in at Brisbane’s sandbag depots. \\nGreens volunteer Harrison Rees has been working shoulder to shoulder with a Liberal for the last three days at the former Toowong Bowls Club site. \\nDespite the imminent federal election, there’s a powerful bipartisanship spirit, including a “no shop talk policy”. \\n \\n Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email \\n \\nAround 20 Greens volunteers, including Brisbane MP Stephen Bates, worked alongside three union members and the single Liberal volunteer to fill thousands of sandbags for pickup early on Thursday afternoon, and the impact their work had was felt immediately. \\n \\n  Related: When and where is Tropical Cyclone Alfred likely to hit? Here’s what you need to know  \\n \\nOn Tuesday, before volunteers showed up to help out, the wait for sandbags was about two hours. On Thursday it was reportedly 20 minutes or less. Trucks arrived every few minutes to drop more sand, and it was gone seemingly just as quickly. \\nGriffith MP Max Chandler-Mather said his entire campaign infrastructure had switched from winning votes to saving homes as the cyclone loomed. \\n“We’ve completely suspended the campaign and redirected every resource we have to helping,” he said. \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\nIt’s the second subsequent time he’s been forced to pause electioneering: hundreds of Griffith campaigners helped clean up after the 2022 Brisbane floods. \\nThis time, it’s a well-oiled machine, hundreds strong. \\nThe sandbag depots only reopened on Thursday morning. Forecasts on Wednesday suggested Tropical Cyclone Alfred would have probably made it too dangerous to do any further preparation by now. Chandler-Mather said he had put the call out that morning and dozens signed up immediately, on site within minutes. \\n“Our strength, I suppose, in the Greens, is the capacity to organise a lot of people,” he said. \\nThey are even doing drop-offs, coordinated from a centre army-style headquarters. \\n“We’ve got a triage system in my office at the moment,” Chandler-Mather said. \\n“Our chief of staff is there, basically triaging any request that comes in, sending out our fleet of utes, picking up extra sandbags for mobility impaired people. \\n“And then when we hear that a particular line has blown out in wait time, we’ll send more volunteers to that one to help clear it, and then we’ll move those excess volunteers somewhere else.” \\nChandler-Mather said that the small band of volunteers would switch to clean-up once the cyclone had passed.  \\nMore than 400,000 sandbags had been distributed in Brisbane by Thursday morning. \\nThousands of people have been through the gates of seven fill-your-own sandbag stations in Acacia Ridge, Toowong, Camp Hill, Boondall, West End, Darra and Murarrie since they reopened at 10.30am on Thursday. \\nMany of them did not stop distribution until late in the night on Tuesday and Wednesday. \\nLachlan Morris, from Ryan MP Elizabeth Watson-Brown’s office, said many people had picked up enough sandbags for themselves and then returned to help others. \\n“There are people that have been here every day,” he said. \\nThe 2011 “mud army” is a Brisbane cultural touchstone. Thousands of ordinary people spontaneously appeared to clear debris from that year’s flood. \\nNobody’s picked a name this year. \\nCfmeu delegate – and sandbag volunteer – Oliver Graham suggested “sand army”. \\n“Every time there’s a natural disaster in Queensland, we tend to pull together. There’s … an instinctual reaction on the part of most people to, sort of, collaborate, help each other, and work together to solve problems,” he said. \\nGraham lives in Rocklea, one of Brisbane’s most flood-prone suburbs. \\nHe predicted he would be working for a few more days yet. \\nGale force winds are expected to start hitting Brisbane within 24 hours, with the Bureau of Meteorology on Thursday forecasting Tropical Cyclone Alfred would make landfall late Friday or early Saturday.

       " '‘Cabin fever’ and Covid-19 flashbacks: how ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred is upending Brisbane life [2025-03-10T14:00:13Z]': 'As they scroll through videos of Brisbane homes being flooded and losing power, Laurence Alexander and Gabrielle Caulfield feel they are probably better off than people living in houses. Their home is a 36-foot Catalina sloop called Rhino which, on Monday morning, is sheltering on the Brisbane River from ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred as the storm continues to cause havoc across south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. \\nRhino, which they had planned to sail from Yamba in NSW to Airlie Beach in the Whitsundays, has its own generator, a gas stove and tanks that hold 300 litres of water. \\n“I’ve seen all these posts of people saying: ‘We’ve got no power and water is coming in’,” Alexander says. “Well, we have power and we’re floating.” \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\nHowever, Alexander, a military veteran, is well aware the pair face a different set of dangers from most householders. For example, they are keeping a close eye on announcements about any water releases from the Wivenhoe and Somerset dams. \\n \\n  Related: Peter Dutton defends attending Hemmes fundraiser as Cyclone Alfred approached Queensland  \\n \\n“The dams, and debris from the dams, that’s our biggest threat,” he says. \\nRhino is tied to the New Farm Park river hub, a relatively new pontoon that doesn’t normally allow overnight moorings. It’s used by party boats, recreational fishers and jetskiers. But on Monday, it had become an impromptu marina for a flotilla of yachts. \\n \\n Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email \\n \\nAlexander says the hub is on a quiet bend of the river, sheltered from large logs and damaging flotsam by an upstream CityCat stop and offering easy access to land should they need to abandon ship. \\nYachties look after one another, he says, and there is safety in numbers. But Caulfield says days of sheltering from rain, tuning to emergency warnings and being rocked by strong winds takes its toll. \\n“You’ve heard the term cabin fever?” she asks. “That’s definitely a thing.” \\nAnd it isn’t only people in boats who feel cooped up. \\nAs drizzle falls on the adjoining riverside suburb of Teneriffe after a night of torrential rain and damaging winds, Diego Camelo is experiencing flashbacks. But he isn’t reliving the 2022 deluge when creeks flash-flooded and rivers burst, innundating tens of thousands of Brisbane homes. \\nMuch of the city has been essentially shut down since Thursday amid warnings from authorities – first, about the then-category two cyclone and then about wind and flood water generated by the weather system. For Camelo, the isolation has generated the same stir-crazy feelings he experienced during the Covid-19 lockdowns. \\n \\n  Related: Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred: tracking rainfall and wind speeds  \\n \\n“YouTube. Netflix. Talking on the phone … I’m getting anxious,” he says. “I hate it. \\n“The coffee shops here have been bustling every morning and I could tell everyone was having the same flashbacks to the lockdown. But worse, this is with rain.” \\nAn industrial engineer from Colombia, Camelo unsuccessfuly tried to get into his office in Northgate on Monday morning. He got stuck in lines of traffic as cars were turned back from flooded roads; he tried different routes but met only flood water or police blocks. He even tried to get to a train station but he didn’t know if he would be able to get home by rail at the end of the day. \\n“I like my office … I spent almost an hour trying to get there this morning,” he says. “I don’t want to be in my place any more, mate.” \\nPeople living alone are feeling deprived of human interaction, but people at home with young children are just as desperate for a moment’s peace. \\nIn nearby Gasworks Plaza, three mothers sit on a bench in front of the supermarket as their three youngest children swap sticker books, snacks and toys and run in circles around their weary carers. \\nNatasha has dropped her five-year-old at one of the few local schools that has opened, but with two-year-old Anna’s gymnastics class cancelled, the pair found themselves at a loose end. At school drop-off they teamed up with another mother, Ashlinn, who can’t go to work because her three-year-old Frankie’s daycare centre is closed. \\n“We drove around looking for anywhere to go and ended up here,” Natasha says. “We bought some Play-Doh from Woolworths and are just trying to make the best of it.” \\nThe third mother, Laura, has her oldest child at school in Windsor, but young Hamish’s daycare is also closed, so she was forced to take the day off work. \\n“This is essentially day five for us,” she says with a stoic smile. “It’s starting to wear thin.” \\nMany small businesses are grateful to have – so far – dodged the worst of the weather. \\nPeter Bartlett, from Rosalie Village Pharmacy, has fortified his business against floods three times in the past decade. \\nLow-lying shops are typically the first to be flooded and he was expecting another tough morning. \\nBut this time it was different; storm water drains were cleared and emptied by this morning. Nobody was flooded.  \\n“I’m pretty confident that we’re fine,” says Bartlett. “We’ve kept the sandbags there and we’ll reassess it, this afternoon. And I guess if we get a heap of rain, or if it’s a heap of rain forecast overnight, then we’ll just put it all back out.” \\nMany business owners in the area say they are relieved, rather than annoyed to have been made to close their doors. \\nTony Frangos from See Drycleaners is waiting until Wednesday to remove an elaborate rampart of timber he nailed up and siliconed in to help protect his business. \\n“Putting it up was a pain, but getting it down should be hopefully easier,” he says.',\n",

He says 46 sites have been brought back online today, with 132 restored since the storm hit. \\n  Generators, satellite services and additional personnel are being moved to strategically significant sites. \\n  The NBN says as of 4.30pm AEDT, there were 252,000 fixed-line and fixed wireless NBN services out across south-east Queensland and northern NSW, with 239,000 of these in Queensland. \\n  \\n Updated at 6.20am GMT \\n \\n \\n  6.00am GMT  \\n  \\n  Thousands of insurance claims lodged \\n  Insurance customers have lodged 3,000 claims in two days as ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred wreaks havoc on homes and businesses, AAP reports. \\n  Insurance Council of Australia chief executive officer Andrew Hall said it was too early to estimate the total insurance bill: \\n   \\n   “However insurers have received around 3,000 claims in the past two days and expect many more thousands of claims as residents return to their homes and understand the full extent of the damage. \\n   \\n  An “insurance catastrophe” has been declared for south-east Queensland and northern NSW, triggering priority treatment for affected policyholders and triaging to ensure those hardest hit receive urgent assistance: \\n   \\n   We encourage impacted policyholders to contact their insurer to begin the claims process. \\n   \\n  Insured losses of $2bn were pencilled in by S&amp;P Global Ratings late last week but fears of a category-two system making landfall did not come to pass, with Alfred downgraded to a tropical low before hitting the coast between Brisbane and Maroochydore on Saturday night. \\n  \\n Updated at 6.22am GMT \\n \\n \\n  5.46am GMT  \\n Where we're at \\n  \\n  Here’s where the news is at as of this afternoon: \\n   \\n   Heavy rainfall is expected to ease from tomorrow afternoon in Queensland, with up to 250mm of rainfall possible in 24 hours. Flood watches remain current, the Bureau of Meteorology said. \\n   There have been warnings of flash flooding for parts of far north NSW, with rain expected to ease tomorrow morning. \\n   Police rescued more than a dozen people from homes and cars in flood-hit Hervey Bay. \\n   The Queensland premier, David Crisafulli, said some schools that were damaged or without power will remain closed tomorrow and advised parents and carers to check tonight for the latest information. \\n   Naplan tests in affected schools will not run on Wednesday but will be held on Monday, 17 March. \\n   Bus services in Brisbane were paused on Sunday. A number of public transport services in south-east Queensland will run to a Sunday timetable on Monday, except services on the Gold Coast which will remain shut down. \\n   Almost 300,000 properties in northern NSW and south-east Queensland remain without power after the storms, with 272,905 in Queensland, 16,000 in NSW. \\n   In Queensland, full restoration of power could take a week, with more than 1,000 power lines down. \\n   164 Telstra mobile sites remain down, 268 Optus mobile sites are down, and more than 250,000 NBN services are offline. \\n   Twelve ADF officers are in hospital after a crash in Lismore on Saturday. The defence minister, Richard Marles, has defended the government using the ADF in its response to the cyclone. \\n   WA premier Roger Cook has welcomed Labor’s “emphatic victory” in the state election, with the party returned to government for a third term. \\n   \\n  \\n Updated at 6.10am GMT \\n \\n \\n  5.28am GMT  \\n  \\n  Torrential rain and winds batter the Gold Coast \\n  At midday yesterday torrential rain and winds gusting up to 60kmh were still battering the Gold Coast. \\n  We were woken by violent squalls at about 4.30 this morning, and barring some brief lulls, it basically hasn’t let up since. \\n  A drive to Southport and Labrador for welfare checks on relatives revealed street after street of debris: what were once towering Norfolk Pines lying sideways across paths, powerlines and parks. Glass from shattered windows is strewn around here and there, and those cars braving the downpour are sending up giant plumes of spray even on major arterials like the Gold Coast Highway. \\n  What must be thousands of metres of police tape can be seen across the coast, trying to cordon off streets flooding or choked with debris, or to keep those few pedestrians out in this clear of trees starting to yaw over in waterlogged ground, looking like one nudge will be enough for wind and gravity to take over. \\n  Traffic lights are out, and police have more pressing matters to attend to than traffic control, so driving – even in a reasonably solid little AWD vehicle - can be on the stressful side of adventurous. \\n  Three days ago we were all sick of waiting for this weather event to arrive. Now we’re sick of waiting for it to just piss off so we can start cleaning up the mess. \\n  \\n \\n \\n  5.18am GMT  \\n  \\n  War of words over idea of sending Australian peacekeepers to Ukraine \\n  Earlier today, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced that an Australian representative would attend a meeting in Paris on Tuesday to discuss a potential peacekeeping force in Ukraine. \\n  Albanese spoke to UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, on Saturday night. \\n  He said he discussed Ukraine with Starmer and the UK’s mooted “coalition of the willing” providing peacekeepers to uphold a negotiated ceasefire: \\n   \\n   There will be a meeting of chiefs of defence and [representatives] of the chiefs of defence in Paris on Tuesday. Australia will send a senior representative to that meeting to discuss going forward. Both of our nations are very clear about our support for Ukraine, and it of course is too early – you can’t have peacekeeping forces without having peace. \\n   Moving forward, though, it is important that planning be put in place, and Australia will participate in that meeting on Tuesday. \\n   \\n  But the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said Albanese needed to put Australian security ahead of international commitments and distant conflicts: \\n   \\n   It’s unbelievable the PM is talking about moving troops from Australia to station them or to base in Ukraine when Italy, Germany, France has made no decision yet to base troops there, and there is no peace to share, no peace to keep. \\n   So what I would say is that the prime minister, instead of shooting from the hip, should make informed judgments on what is in our country’s best interest. We know, as the prime minister says, we live in the most precarious period since the second world war and, if that is the case, then we should be doing everything we can to bolster our security and our defences and to make sure that we’re investing in, not taking away from, the capacity of the Australian defence force. And my judgment is that basing troops in Europe at the moment is the wrong decision for our country. \\n   \\n  Dutton said it appeared the prime minister had failed to take advice from the chief of the defence force and had not consulted his national security committee, because other senior ministers in the defence portfolio had tried to “walk back” his earlier comments on an Australian peacekeeping force. \\n  \\n Updated at 5.46am GMT \\n \\n \\n  5.13am GMT  \\n  \\n  South-east Queensland water supplies \\n  Emma Thomas, chief executive of SEQwater in Queensland, said there were two water treatment plants out of action – one in Dayboro and one in Canungra – but both had full reservoirs, so they would be able to provide water to those communities while work went on to get the plants back online. \\n  Canungra’s plant has been switched off because there is a lot of water coming in that has runoff and sediment in it. \\n  On Wivenhoe dam releases, Thomas said none were planned at the moment but if one did happen, people would be given as much notice as possible: \\n   \\n   The catchments have had relatively little rainfall in them. So we haven’t had a lot of rainfall running into those catchment areas. But as we’ve seen up in Hervey Bay, where there have been significant rainfalls today in small pockets, those situations and circumstances can change very quickly, which is why our flood operations engineers are monitoring those weather cells and patterns very, very carefully to see what is actually coming and being able to adjust and adapt as we need to. \\n   \\n  \\n Updated at 5.42am GMT \\n \\n \\n  5.05am GMT  \\n Queensland school closures \\n  \\n  If you’re looking for the Queensland school closures website it is here. \\n  As of 10 minutes ago, it was reporting 481 state school closures, 201 independent school closures and 167 Catholic school closures. \\n  \\n Updated at 5.09am GMT \\n \\n \\n  4.57am GMT  \\n  \\n  ABC 612AM radio is back up after going down for a few hours.

The press conference has ended. \\n  \\n Updated at 4.58am GMT \\n \\n \\n  4.39am GMT  \\n Peter Dutton press conference \\n  \\n  The federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is giving a press conference in Moreton Bay. \\n  After paying tribute to the councils’ and state government response to Ex-Cyclone Alfred, Dutton is asked whether he would support tax cuts in the March budget. \\n  He says he would welcome them because families are “under enormous pressure” due to prices going up, but says he wants income tax cuts “responsibly delivered” so inflation doesn’t continue to be a problem, causing the RBA to raise interest rates: \\n   \\n   The government energy policy is driving up the cost of electricity and gas bills and the government is pretending that by giving back a couple of hundred dollars of that is compensation for a bad decision and a bad policy the Labor government has made. It’s not, and Australians are smarter than that. \\n   \\n  \\n Updated at 4.58am GMT \\n \\n \\n  4.27am GMT  \\n  \\n  ABC 612AM’s transmitters in Brisbane are down – people can tune to 106.1FM or digital radio for emergency updates in that area. \\n  \\n Updated at 4.32am GMT \\n \\n \\n  4.23am GMT  \\n  \\n  Queensland police defend alert system \\n  On whether a seek-shelter warning should have been issued yesterday before the heavy rainfall overnight, Queensland police deputy commissioner Shane Chelepy said at that point in time it would not have been the right advice for those areas. \\n  He said the emergency alert system worked in tandem with the bureau’s early warning system and the local council system. \\n  \\n Updated at 4.32am GMT \\n \\n \\n  4.12am GMT  \\n  \\n  ‘Do all you can to get life back to normal,’ Crisafulli says \\n  David Crisafulli says parents and carers will be given as much advance notice as possible before the next school day whether their child’s school will be opening. \\n  He said some schools had suffered significant damage, and some were without power, and those would stay closed until they’re safe, but where there was an option to bring pupils back they would open: \\n   \\n   Education matters, and it’s important we give kids every chance. The other thing is – those parents of those kids are important Queenslanders. Some of them will be the nurse at the hospital that means the difference between someone having their emergency surgery or not. Some of them will be that supermarket worker who’s stacking the shelf to enable someone to feed their family after not being able to go to shops for a few days. So it’s important, wherever possible, we give every chance to return things to normal. It’s got to be safe. It’s got to have common sense. But, wherever possible, you do all you can to get life back to normal. \\n   \\n  \\n Updated at 4.21am GMT \\n \\n \\n  4.08am GMT  \\n  \\n  ‘I can’t fault Queenslanders for the way they’ve prepared’ \\n  The Queensland premier, David Crisafulli, is asked whether the government was caught off guard by the strength of the winds overnight. \\n  He said cyclones presented a risk and authorities always had to be ready for all of it – winds, waves, rain and flooding: \\n   \\n   A system like a cyclone will continue to provide a challenge even once it crosses land. I’ll make the point that, last night in Toowoomba, there was wind gusts recorded of nearly 100km/h. They are challenges that will always be presented. But that’s why you’ve got to do the preparation. I can’t fault Queenslanders for the way they’ve prepared. I think, if you look objectively, this – you’ve got such a large, populated area of people who’ve never been to a cyclone before, and the way the community responded, I think, was first-class. \\n   \\n  \\n Updated at 4.14am GMT \\n \\n \\n  4.05am GMT  \\n  \\n  About 120,000 Queensland dwellings reconnected to power \\n  Energex and Ergon have now reconnected 120,000 Queensland properties to power, including 40,000 today, including in Toowoomba, Hervey Bay and south-east Queensland. \\n  There are still 320,000 properties without power, which the more than 2,000 workers in the field will reconnect in the coming days. There are 1,500 live lines on the ground, and residents are advised to stay away from them and report them when they see them. \\n  \\n Updated at 4.09am GMT \\n \\n \\n  4.01am GMT  \\n No lives lost or missing persons recorded from Alfred in Queensland so far \\n  \\n  The Queensland police deputy commissioner, Shane Chelepy, says there has been no loss of life or missing persons in Queensland as a result of the weather event. \\n  He said a public safety declaration was issued this morning for Hervey Bay, giving police additional emergency powers to carry out evacuations and to support the community due to the flash flooding. \\n  An emergency alert was also issued for the Fraser Coast coastal areas due to heavy, intense rainfall. People are being asked to take shelter. \\n  In Hervey Bay, police were deployed to rescue people from their houses, cars, and businesses. There have been seven rescues from vehicles, and nine from dwellings. \\n  The Hervey Bay watch house has been evacuated to Maryborough, and a temporary police station was established at the St James school in Hervey Bay. \\n  There have been 35 callouts for police, including 14 people who were in danger of losing their life. \\n  \\n Updated at 4.59am GMT \\n \\n \\n  3.55am GMT  \\n  \\n  ‘This event is still not over’, BoM meteorologist says \\n  The Bureau of Meteorology’s Sue Oates gives a run-through of some of the weather in the past day, which we have covered earlier. On the forecast for the next 24 hours, she said coastal conditions were starting to ease, but there was still the odd 4m wave coming through. \\n  She said those are reducing and will continue to reduce, but that Queensland is through the worst of coastal hazards. \\n  Severe weather warnings remain current, and that’s for heavy to locally intense rainfall and damaging winds. \\n  The gusts will continue to ease into the night period, but rainfall will continue to be heavy, and flash flooding is a high risk. \\n  It is expected there will be six-hourly rainfall totals of 80 to 130mm today, with 24-hour totals of 120-200mm, but up to 250mm is possible. \\n  Oates said: \\n   \\n   A flood watch remains current, and the flood watch continues to extend from the Mary River in the north to the Queensland border, including the South Coast creeks, the Logan and Albert River and westward to include the Condamine River and the Macintyre River. There are also a series of flood warnings out, with major flooding for the Bremer River, Laurel Creek and the Logan River, and a series of minor to moderate flood warnings also across that flood watch area. And we’ll continue to monitor that rainfall throughout the day. And the flood warnings will be updated as we observe heavy rainfall and run-off into those river systems. \\n   So, in summary, this event is still not over. We are starting to see an easing of the coastal conditions and an easing in the damaging wind gusts that were observed in the last 24 hours. However, the rainfall will continue and the risk of intense rainfall with localised flash flooding is real. \\n   \\n  \\n Updated at 4.03am GMT \\n \\n \\n  3.48am GMT  \\n  \\n  ‘Our resolve will be unwavering’ \\n  David Crisafulli ends his remarks on the health system, stating the health networks will be liaising directly with patients. The Tugun and Redlands satellite health centres will remain closed. \\n  He said cleanup has begun today. Some supermarkets have reopened and will continue to do so on a case-by-case basis. \\n  Crisafulli said: \\n   \\n   Finally, I want to finish with a message to Queenslanders. It’s firstly one of great gratitude, great gratitude for the way that neighbours have helped neighbours. Strangers have helped strangers and throughout this I’ve spoken about those four challenges and things like the wind and the waves and the rain and then the flooding. And we’ve seen different parts of a broad area and a populated area experience different ones of these at different times. But one thing’s remained consistent, and that is the community spirit and the resolve. \\n   And I want the community to know that there won’t be daylight between the response and the recovery, because that’s what makes communities. And we’ve seen throughout this event the goodwill of this community. And I have every confidence because of that, that it will be a strong recovery. And I want to assure Queenslanders that our resolve from one end of the state to the other, who in the last month have been hit with a series of challenges, our resolve to see that job through and to make sure that this great state gets back on its feet, will be unwavering. And we’ll be here for the long haul. \\n   \\n  \\n Updated at 4.01am GMT \\n \\n \\n  3.46am GMT  \\n  \\n  On hardship payments, David Crisafulli says the Queensland government is working with the federal government, and they’ll be outlining eligibility and what it covers soon, and ensuring funds flow quickly. \\n  There will also be a number of Queensland community recovery hubs, with the first to open very shortly.

For those schools in affected areas, it will be delayed to Monday 17 March. \\n   \\n   It’s important that important testing goes ahead. So it will proceed on Wednesday, if you’re not impacted, if you have been impacted, there is that window. So kids can still have their Naplan testing.

We’ve seen that culminate in reports of flash flooding in homes and in businesses. There has been a number of swift water rescues, and I just want to say a huge debt of gratitude to those emergency services personnel. \\n   They were there and pre-positioned, and the work that they did. Is the matter of saving lives. And that’s why we’re incredibly grateful to the people of that community. And I know it’s a tight knit community. We’ll certainly be there to see things through for, for the Hervey Bay community.

Secondly, he reaffirmed his commitment and our joint commitment to Aukus going forward, and we had a discussion about that. \\n   Thirdly, we did discuss the issue of Ukraine and the coalition of the willing, as he has put it, going forward. There will be a meeting of chiefs of defence and [representatives] of the chiefs of defence in Paris on Tuesday. Australia will send a senior representative to that meeting to discuss going forward. Both of our nations are very clear about our support for Ukraine, and it of course is too early – you can’t have peacekeeping forces without having peace. \\n   Moving forward, though, it is important that planning be put in place, and Australia will participate in that meeting on Tuesday. \\n   \\n  \\n Updated at 11.00pm GMT \\n \\n \\n  10.42pm GMT  \\n  \\n  Continuing on the same topic of the ADF’s role in natural disaster response, Marles said government is working with National Emergency Management Australia, the emergency minister Jenny McAllister, and state emergency services, about “how - going forward - we structure our responses to natural disasters,”. \\n  He continued: \\n   \\n   That is an important conversation to be had, and the relative resources that are there from the various agencies. That’s what the Defence Strategic Review was referring to. But, in a given disaster right now, Defence will always be there to present. \\n   \\n  \\n Updated at 10.42pm GMT \\n \\n \\n  10.34pm GMT  \\n  \\n  Marles has been asked about reliance on the ADF during natural disasters after authors of the Defence Strategic Review were “quite adamant that the ADF wasn’t structured or equipped to be a disaster recovery, disaster response agency, alongside all of its other responsibilities,” as put by the reporter.  \\n  The deputy prime minister said the ADF vehicles and personnel deployed were “enormously useful in respect of route clearance”: \\n   \\n   The Defence Strategic Review referred to the fact that an increasing number of climate events was giving rise to an increasing use of the Defence Force in terms of natural disasters. In a macro sense, we needed to be thinking about how we supported all of our governmental efforts in terms of responding to natural disasters and ensuring that Defence was the last port of call.  \\n   That said, in respect of any particular incident right now, it is obviously going to be the case, and will always be the case while we are here, that Defence will be there ready to provide support when they have unique assets that can be provided. In this instance, the vehicles that defence had - the personnel that they had - were enormously useful in respect of route clearance.  \\n   But, as we look forward in this natural disaster, airlift capability, personnel fundamentally doing doorknocking, everyone stepping in and helping, is something that, in the here and now, we will obviously be providing. \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n  10.29pm GMT  \\n  \\n  PM confirms man swept off bridge near Dorrigo has died \\n  The 61-year-old man swept off a bridge by fast-moving flood waters near Dorrigo on Friday has died, Albanese confirms. \\n   \\n   Our thoughts are with his loved ones and the community at this heartbreaking time. \\n   \\n  The prime minister warns of “very dangerous” flash-flooding and heavy winds in Queensland and northern NSW: \\n   \\n   Heavy rainfall, damaging wind gusts, and coastal surf impacts are expected to continue over coming days.

That’s what each of these 32 people were doing yesterday in support of those who were feeling the brunt of ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred in northern New South Wales. They did so without question. They wanted to make a difference. This is why they had signed up. \\n   But they also knew that they were in a difficult circumstance where the weather was obviously making conditions treacherous and, in that sense, they were putting themselves voluntarily in danger.

Part of the city’s design is that tributaries of the Brisbane River – Breakfast/Enoggera Creek, Kedron Brook, Ithaca Creek, Oxley Creek and Norman Creek – act as floodways, providing a buffer to homes and buildings. \\n  That works until it doesn’t – major floods have resulted when the creeks could no longer hold the volume of water sent into the system. In 2017 and 2022, flooding was the result of huge rainfall in a relatively short period. \\n  This morning, Enoggera Creek on the north side had already spilled over, swallowing bridges and walkways. \\n  This does happen regularly in heavy rain. But it also illustrates that parts of Brisbane are now seriously vulnerable if the rainfall continues or worsens. \\n  \\n Updated at 11.04pm GMT \\n \\n \\n  9.32pm GMT  \\n Emergency warnings for 14,600 people, NSW SES says \\n  \\n  The NSW state emergency service has received more than 10,309 calls and responded to almost 6000 incidents, it said in an update this morning. \\n  It urged affected communities to “remain vigilant and not become complacent” after Alfred weakened to a tropical low. \\n  About 14,600 people are under emergency warnings as of 5am AEDT this morning, and about 31,200 dwellings are subject to warnings as a result of flooding, the update said. \\n  \\n Updated at 9.40pm GMT \\n \\n \\n  9.19pm GMT  \\n ADF vehicle crash was a rollover, not a collision, police say \\n  \\n  The two Australian Defence Force vehicles that crashed south-west of Lismore yesterday did not collide with each other, NSW police have said in an updated statement. \\n  The ADF was deployed to Lismore to help with preparations for the effects of ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred. \\n  Emergency services were called to Tregeagle Road about 5pm after one ADF military vehicle left the roadway and rolled several times into a paddock, and a second tipped on to its side attempting to avoid the first vehicle, NSW police said. The vehicles did not collide with each other. \\n  Each vehicle was carrying a driver and 15 passengers. \\n  All 32 occupants were removed and treated at the scene, then taken to hospitals in Lismore, Tweed Heads, Ballina and Byron Bay for assessment. \\n  Thirteen people required treatment.

It is “very dangerous,” Hall says: \\n   \\n   There’s still a lot of debris, lots of big trees down, lots of big trees crossing roads and falling on to cars and power lines and, so, yeah, very dangerous. As the water recedes, it does bring out more debris as well. So you’ve got to be really careful. \\n   And the roads are already in pretty poor condition following 2022. So doesn’t take much for them to be waterlogged and have their own structural issues as well. \\n   \\n  The Lismore deputy mayor says the region is “still in recovery” after the 2022 floods: \\n   \\n   There’s still businesses that haven’t been able to come back or have just come back and are just starting to trade again. Trade is down obviously with the cost of living and everybody doing it a little bit tough, but people manage to come back and then this happens again and it really breaks your spirit. \\n   So, yeah, the recovery has been long since 2022, let’s hope because it hasn’t overtopped the levee at this point that it won’t be as big a recovery – but, yeah, we still have heaps of work to do from 2022. So we just have to bite down and get it done. \\n   \\n  \\n Updated at 9.45pm GMT \\n \\n \\n  8.55pm GMT  \\n  \\n  ‘If you can get to sleep during all of the rain, you’re having nightmares about it’: Lismore deputy mayor \\n  More than 250 people are in the Lismore evacuation centre at Southern Cross University as of last night, Jeri Hall says.

       " 'Why did Tropical Cyclone Alfred slow down on its destructive path towards Australia’s east coast? [2025-03-07T01:01:21Z]': 'Millions of people in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales awoke on Thursday expecting a day of damaging winds and rainfall as Tropical Cyclone Alfred bore down. But overnight the system slowed down, with forecasts that it might not make landfall until early Saturday. So what’s been happening to Tropical Cyclone Alfred?  What has changed?  On Wednesday morning the various models the Bureau of Meteorology’s cyclone team analyses were suggesting that Alfred would probably make landfall early on Friday morning. But by Wednesday evening the eye of the storm was slightly further away from the Queensland coast, after performing a full loop during the day instead of continuing to move towards the coast. “Alfred basically stalled and almost did a loop-de-loop back on itself,” said a BoM meteorologist, Christie Johnson. Why has Alfred slowed down?  The movement of a cyclone is down to the “steering flow” – the average wind speed between about 2km and 10km in the atmosphere. On Tuesday Tropical Cyclone Alfred ran into a high-pressure ridge that is sitting over the Tasman Sea which pushed it off its south-east trajectory and turned it towards the Queensland coast.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email  Prof Liz Ritchie-Tyo, a cyclone expert at Monash University, said: “When it took that sharp turn, it came under the influence of that ridge and they tend to have much lighter winds associated with them.” But why didn’t the models pick up that the cyclone would slow down? Ritchie-Tyo said the cyclone had taken its turn to the coast slightly further north than many of the models expected, and this meant the steering flow had been slightly weaker. “This is like the butterfly effect, where a small error in a model means the prediction farther out is error-prone. But now the model runs are picking this up pretty well.” How fast is the cyclone moving and when might it reach the Queensland coast?  On Thursday morning Alfred was moving at about 7km/h – relatively slow for a cyclone, according to Ritchie-Tyo.   Related: When and where is Tropical Cyclone Alfred likely to hit? Here’s what you need to know    “There’s no suggestion it’s going to pick up much speed,” she said. “So that means the winds and rain will stay over the same area for longer.” Johnson said Alfred was expected to move slowly and there was a suggestion it could stall as it approached the coast. “Cyclones can get steered by other influences and can be a bit like a leaf in a storm, with eddies pushing this way and that,” she said. Another area of low pressure over the north of the country could interact with the storm, causing it to slow and stall again off the coast. There was even a suggestion that for a short time it could speed up overnight Thursday into Friday, before slowing again. On Thursday the Queensland premier, David Crisafulli, said the most likely scenario was a coastal crossing Saturday morning – pretty much 24 hours later than communities had been preparing for. When might people start to feel the impacts?  Coastal communities on the Gold Coast and northern New South Wales were already feeling the effects and these would continue to intensify, according to Johnson. Much of the south-east Queensland coast, from Gympie to the NSW border, was under a severe weather warning on Friday for intense rainfall and damaging winds. What intensity will Alfred be when it makes landfall?  Johnson said on Wednesday that some models were suggesting Alfred could intensify into a category-three system before it made landfall, with even more destructive winds, but the chances of that had fallen away. “The chances of it intensifying has reduced and it’s now expected to be a category one at landfall but for much of the approach it could still be a high-end category two,” she said. On Friday morning, the cyclone was forecast to weaken slightly to a category one storm in the final hours before landfall, expected around 10am on Saturday in an area between Double Island Point and just south of Brisbane. Cyclone categories only reflect wind speeds and don’t account for the amount of rainfall or flooding. Johnson said while the landfall was expected to be in the vicinity of Brisbane city, with one US model having it slightly north, it was important people did not focus on that aspect. Destructive winds, extreme rainfall, flooding and coastal impacts were likely to occur over a wide area, from the Sunshine Coast to northern NSW.

       " 'Welfare recipients told to perform mutual obligations as Tropical Cyclone Alfred bears down on Queensland [2025-03-06T14:00:09Z]': 'Private employment agencies across Queensland have given jobseekers the impression they still need to perform their mutual obligations, despite there being a pause across large swaths of the state while it prepares for Tropical Cyclone Alfred. The mutual obligations scheme forces jobseekers to complete tasks such as applying for jobs or attending training, or risk their payments being stopped.   Related: Cyclone Alfred live updates: Brisbane, Queensland and NSW BoM path tracking map; landfall time and category; weather forecasts TC Alfred rain and flooding warnings –\\xa0latest Australia news    The Department of Employment and Workforce Relations pre-emptively paused MOs from Tuesday 4 March until Thursday 13 March for jobseekers in Sunshine Coast, Somerset, Wivenhoe, Gold Coast, Darling Downs, Brisbane South East and parts of New South Wales.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email  Disability employment provider, Help, which has 47 offices around Queensland – with many in or near the paused locations – sent an email to clients on Wednesday informing them they were still having to undergo phone appointments. The email, seen by Guardian Australia, says face-to-face appointments will be moved to over the phone. “Our offices will be closed, but telephone appointments will continue as normal,” it reads. “Any scheduled in-person appointments will be rescheduled or changed to phone appointments. Your consultant will be in touch with further details.”    After Guardian Australia contacted Help, it’s chief operations officer, David Avery, said: “Help is not enforcing any Mutual Obligations, nor will there be any compliance action taken for those wishing to cancel appointments. “Help is not conducting mutual obligation appointments; voluntary appointments are available for those who wish to continue their servicing remotely,” he said. “Our work involves supporting our clients through hardship and helping to build the confidence of people with disability. We will be contacting our clients again to reaffirm that our services are voluntary.” One jobseeker, who received the email and did not want to be named, said she did not know there was a suspension to MOs in place until she went on social media. “They completely omitted the fact that there is an exemption in place,” she said. “Anyone in the system who has dealt with [job providers] would regard that as a mandatory requirement because that is how every mandatory requirement is presented to them. “The [job providers] are aware that they hold all the power over participants, and they use it to coerce people into extra appointments, useless courses or volunteer busywork so they can make more money.” Jay Coonan, researcher at Antipoverty Centre, said they had also given assistance to someone else in Brisbane who said they had been told they needed to attend an in-person meeting – despite the pause. “This isn’t a one-off issue, it’s a systemic issue,” Coonan said. “They are told at the top level of the business and information is provided to individual case workers through their IT portals.” On Thursday morning Help sent a follow-up email to the jobseekers on their books, clarifying the appointments were voluntary. It would not say how many phone appointments went ahead before the second email was sent. The confusion over the pause comes as three reviews and an ombudsman investigation have been launched into the controversial system and if it is being used legally by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR), which runs it. Coonan said providers being unclear with jobseekers during cyclone preparation was “truly astounding”. “The question of whether or not “mutual” obligations are even legal is bad enough as it is,” he said. On Monday the Antipoverty Centre sent a letter to the federal employment minister, Murray Watt, to pause mutual obligation while the reviews take place. In response, a spokesperson for DEWR said no participant’s payment will be affected if they do not attend appointments with providers or meet other requirements that would usually apply. “The department has communicated the pause to providers through direct messages to impacted participants and through the providers’ IT system, via the department’s Provider Portal, updates to the Workforce Australia website, in support resources for our National Customer Service Line, and with social media posts. Services Australia is also communicating the pause.” Department of Social Services, which operates disability support service, did not reply before the deadline.

       " '‘A perfect storm’: the dedicated rescuers caring for sodden seabirds blown in by Cyclone Alfred [2025-03-14T23:00:33Z]': 'Most people in Brisbane were battening down the hatches ahead of the arrival of Tropical Cyclone Alfred. For a few, though, it was one of the most exciting natural events of their lives. Over the course of the weekend and into Monday, throngs of birdwatchers lined the shores of Bramble Bay in the bayside suburbs of Shorncliffe, Sandgate and Redcliffe, telescopes and cameras at the ready. But the excitement of seeing birds that usually spend their lives at sea up close as they were pushed up against the coast – some flopping into suburban back yards, barely able to walk – was tempered by sadness and pity.   Related: In the middle of cyclone preparation I found a baby bird – one tiny, wild life amid the wind and rain | Jessie Cole    While seabirds are highly evolved to survive in extreme environments, cyclones cause mass casualties. Unable to land or find food in the churning ocean, they become exhausted and quickly lose conditioning. Many are carried hundreds of kilometres inland, where they invariably perish. The lucky ones are found and taken into care.  Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads  For Twinnies Pelican And Seabird Rescue, a bird rescue charity run by identical twins Paula and Bridgette Powers, the weeks after a cyclone are hectic, with dozens of birds transferred to their rehabilitation centre in Landsborough on the Sunshine Coast. “I’m so glad we never got hit like Brisbane and the Gold Coast, but we were worried about these seabirds out there copping it,” they say.    A conversation with the twins is a unique experience. They don’t just finish each other’s sentences; they speak in unison and in stereo. But they are united by a love of all creatures great and small. They tend to a masked booby, a gannet-like bird lucky to survive the night. It’s in a bad way, waterlogged, shivering and infested with bird lice. At one point, it rocks back and forth. “His waterproofing is not the best,” they say. “When they come in not waterproof, it takes a while to get them ready for release.” Seabirds have an oil gland at the base of their tail, which they first rub their heads against, then over their feathers for waterproofing. As their condition deteriorates, they lack the energy to administer this routine self-care. Its prospects look grim. “It’s a bit too early at the moment to say, because he’s so exhausted anything can happen,” the twins say. “Their little hearts can just give in. But at least he’s in a nice warm bed, not in the ocean. We’ll give it our all, won’t we darling?”    A pelican – recovered after being pushed up against the rocks at Golden beach, Caloundra – is looking better, despite suffering from botulism. “It can be caused by many things, like a carcass in the water, but all this rain stirs up everything,” they say. “He’s been standing and sitting, which is a good sign. His eyes are a lot more moist – they were really dry and closed when he was brought in.” Prof Richard Fuller, from the School of the Environment at the University of Queensland, says such storms are “incredibly disruptive”. “Suddenly these birds are on a coastline with which they have no familiarity or real concept of what to do, their usual food sources are gone and the weather conditions are atrocious. So it’s really kind of a perfect storm,” he says – no pun intended, of course. But, he says, such events also present a rare opportunity. “Many seabirds are declining dramatically all around the world. We’ve noticed that here in Australia too, so these events give us an insight into what’s happening out there in the ocean, and gathering that information is really useful. “To track seabird populations we need to monitor them, and that’s usually done at breeding colonies, but this gives us a window into what’s happening at sea when birds are away from their nesting areas. “We had a shy albatross, for example, which is incredibly rare in this part of the world; this record shows that there are still some of those birds here.”    Some are even rarer. At least two Leach’s storm petrels were photographed over the weekend – a species recorded only once previously in Queensland, with fewer than 10 confirmed nationwide.   Related: Expert concerned as large rafts of invasive fire ants seen floating in flood waters after Cyclone Alfred     “Storms of course are natural events, and mass mortality during storms is part of the biology of seabirds,” Fuller says. “It’s a massive event, so a lot of birders were awestruck by what was happening.” For 23-year-old Kye Turnbull, it was a lifetime thrill. He spent the entire weekend at Bramble Bay standing in the teeth of the gale, prompting one online friend to inquire jokingly whether he required food drops. “It’s the most awesome birding event I’ve ever experienced,” he says. “After [Tropical Cyclone] Oswald in 2013 – which I missed out on for being too young, I’ve been waiting for this to happen, and it’s finally happened. Yesterday was probably the best birding experience ever for me.” For some it was an expensive experience too, as their equipment was buffeted by wind and torrential rain. “I saw quite a few cameras die yesterday.”',\n",
       " 'Queensland’s Bribie Island braces for Cyclone Alfred: secure the boat, pile sandbags and hunker down [2025-03-03T10:36:18Z]': 'Liam Mac Court was awoken around 6am on Monday by a phone call that every boat owner dreads. Red Cloud, his 30-foot Fastback catamaran named after the indomitable Lakota warrior chief, had been ripped from its mooring in the Pumicestone Passage and driven into the concrete embankments on the lee side of Bribie Island. So, as many of the rest of the islanders prepared to defend their homes from a tropical cyclone menacing the coastal community just north of Brisbane – along with large swathes of south-east Queensland – Mac Court grabbed the crutches he’s been hobbling on since a recent bike accident, called his son Luke, and set out to try to secure his catamaran. He found Red Cloud near the bridge connecting the sand island to the mainland beside White Bird, another unmoored boat – and chuckled at the cadence of names.   Related: Tropical Cyclone Alfred could make landfall near Brisbane. Why is this a big deal and when could it hit?     A former Baptist pastor who still carries Swords, Dublin, in his accent, Mac Court – lover of words and people – quotes William Butler Yeats as he talks of the “terrible beauty” inside the latter, even as the wind whips the normally becalmed passage into a grey churn of white caps.    And what of the looming storm, does it too contain a terrible beauty? “Oh it’s magnificent!” Mac Court says with gusto in his Irish lilt. “The forces at work! What can one man on crutches do, except enjoy and admire it all? “And the people! I’ve had hugs, I’ve had kisses, I’ve had people bring me coffees”. People have also brought in 14 heavy tyres that are tied to the side of the boat to try to limit hull damage. As he speaks, Luke leaps on and off Red Cloud in an effort to temporarily secure the catamaran, and a council backhoe parts the onlookers. The plan is to dig in a 1.5 tonne concrete block to which to tether the rogue boats with chains and hope they can ride out what is set to be a wild few days of weather. “I’m praying it will all go well,” Mac Court says.    Cyclone Alfred is tracking towards the south-east Queensland coast and could make landfall on Thursday, and surging tides are already reported to be gushing right over narrower and uninhabited parts of the low-lying island. Mac Court, though, is not at all concerned about his own wellbeing, and philosophical about that of the boat. “It’s only fibreglass,” he says. According to the Bureau of Meteorology’s cyclone forecast, published on Monday evening, the storm was due to grow to category two on Tuesday, slow and then make a sharp right turn towards the south-east Queensland coast. It was expected to maintain intensity as a category two and make landfall between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast late on Thursday or Friday morning. Communities from Sandy Cape south to Grafton, including Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast and Byron Bay, were in the watch zone.   Related: People urged to prepare for the worst as Tropical Cyclone Alfred bears down on south-east Queensland    While Mac Court remains sanguine, others on Bribie Island are far more worried for their own safety – some are preparing to evacuate. Up the road, towards the surf side of the island, at the local State Emergency Service, people queue to collect sandbags with which to defend homes. Jill Sanders is filling the boot of her hatchback with bags to line against her front door and the ranch sliding doors at the back of her duplex home.    She has lived at Banksia Beach for 24 years and this is a first – she says she never expected to have to hunker down against the threat of a cyclone. “But you know, things change so you’ve just got to go with the flow,” she says serenely. Sanders has become accustomed to painful change in recent years – her husband died in 2022.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email  “So this is the first thing that I’ll have to cope with by myself,” she says. “That’s why I am lugging these by myself.” After filling her boot Sanders plans to head home and run the bath – as an emergency supply of water. Then bring in outdoor furniture and pull down hanging plants. “I have torches and candles, all of that stuff,” she says. “I should be fine. I’ve got good neighbours.”    As she loads, Tanya Rivera and Kiana Kilford wait patiently for council trucks to bring more sand so they can take their fill. “Sandbags are gonna be a while!,” yells a lean man in a singlet that reveals his tattooed arms. “Council’s dropping them off.” The pair can wait, though, Rivera says. This is one of the last steps they have to take to prepare. “Yesterday the whole family started blowing up my family chat on Facebook, sending so many articles, news reports,” the 29-year-old says. “That’s when I realised the severity of the cyclone. “Then, last night, I couldn’t sleep much ‘cause it was so windy, we could just hear the door slamming, so we figured it was going to be serious and we had to prepare.” Rivera and Kilford, who run a production company, packed down outdoor furniture and fishing gear into the shed and stocked up on cans of tuna, beans, toilet paper and muesli bars – they had to buy small children’s bottles of water as that was in such short supply. Other than collecting sandbags, the last remaining step for them to prepare for Alfred’s possible arrival was to pack bags in case they are forced to flee, Rivera says. “Food, toiletries, emergency kits, torches, medication and, of course, some food for the pets,” she says. “I’m a little bit nervous and if we have to evacuate … that’s a scary thing”.    Others have different priorities when stocking up on essentials. A pair of retirees from Tasmania who have spent the last five months housesitting a home on a Bribie canal emerge from a supermarket whose shelves are being stripped of still and mineral water, bread, toilet paper, long-life milk and canned spaghetti. They don’t want to share their names but are happy to divulge their shopping list. “Grog, toilet paper, that’s the main things I suppose,” she says. “Oh and veggies. And dog food.” She is worried the garden will ‘get a bit stuffed up” as the pair have kept it in good nick and the owners are due home in a few weeks, but feel well prepared to last Alfred out. “We’ve got brandy, champagne for when it’s over, and a couple of bottles of wine to last us until then”.',\n",
       " 'Brisbane council accused of ‘cruel’ and ‘heartless’ crackdown on homeless in wake of Cyclone Alfred [2025-03-13T09:28:07Z]': 'For a year and a half, Paul Slater has helped provide homeless Brisbane residents a place to live. He’s handed out hundreds of tents; during the city’s worst housing crisis in living memory, they’ve proven a residence of last resort for many. On Thursday, Slater, the head of North West Community Group, was threatened with a fine by Brisbane city council if he persisted.   Related:‘I’m ready’: why John is determined to weather Cyclone Alfred in his tent despite authorities’ warnings    “The council has essentially told me that I had 24 hours to remove the tents from Musgrave Park, and that I’m not allowed to put tents on public land any more, and that they would be enforcing the laws, which allow them to fine up to $8,000 for putting tents up,” Slater says. “They’re trying to make it illegal to be homeless, which is the same thing that the Moreton council have done.” In the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Alfred, Brisbane city council on Thursday announced a plan to crack down on rough sleepers, asking police to “ensure anyone living in a park who has refused accommodation is moved on within 24 hours”. The lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, said the council would also “remove unused empty tents”.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email  He’s not the first; a similar crackdown by the City of Moreton Bay went into effect on Wednesday. Schrinner said his action came in response to reports “people who are homeless by choice” are planning to “pour into Brisbane” from Moreton Bay. Condemnation was swift. The Greens called it “cruel and hypocritical”. The Labor council opposition said it was “heartless”. A costly diversion In Melbourne, another council is considering the same hardline approach to homelessness. The City of Port Phillip, which spans a number of inner Melbourne suburbs including beachside St Kilda, voted last week to investigate changing local laws to prohibit people from sleeping rough on council land. It said the move came in response to pressure by residents complaining about antisocial behaviour. Laura Mahoney, executive director of homelessness solutions and impact at Launch Housing, told Guardian Australia that on any given day it had about 800 people across metropolitan Melbourne waiting for a bed in crisis supported accommodation. Peter McGrath, the Salvation Army’s state manager of homelessness in Victoria, says Port Phillip council’s decision to investigate changing laws will be a “costly exercise” that will “cause more harm than good”. McGrath warned that resources required to enforce the laws, including police and the state’s magistrates court, would only divert resources away from more serious matters. Crystel, a First Nations woman residing in Launch Housing’s 15-bed supported crisis accommodation in St Kilda, has spent stints sleeping rough in Melbourne.    “Everybody who is homeless has suffered some sort of trauma … Now they’ve got the council looking down on them,” she says of the City of Port Phillips potential move. “It’s kicking someone when they’re already down. “I don’t think it’s right. It’s not right at all.” ‘Homelessness is never a choice’ As Tropical Cyclone Alfred bore down on south-east Queensland, hundreds of homeless people abandoned their tents, taking shelter in temporary evacuation centres.   Related:Lynette is on the pension, a casual teacher, a golf instructor – and homeless    The government has repeatedly claimed that all homeless people taking shelter were offered emergency accommodation in the meantime.  Schrinner has used that claim to suggest that “people are living in parks, in tents by choice”. Only those people would be targeted by the crackdown, he has said. He says all council is doing is asking North West Community Group not to put up any more tents, and that council has instructed staff not to threaten homeless people with fines. “What council can do is we can make sure that there are no tents in parks, and so we’ll give 24 hours notice, once we have a chance to talk to each individual, that the tents will be removed, and we will be removing those tents,” he says. The chief executive officer of Micah Projects, Karyn Walsh, says of about 261 people it registered as seeking accommodation during the cyclone, 146 have been denied it due to a lack of identification. Another 44 with identification are still waiting for accommodation. A minority, only 71 people, have received accommodation, she says. “People are still waiting because not everyone was offered accommodation.” Nourish Street founder Beau Haywood, who feeds street sleepers in Moreton Bay, says he has the names and phone numbers of 57 individuals who never received an offer. “They’ve put their names down with housing multiple times. They engage with housing constantly, and they’ve not been offered a thing,” he says. For those who have refused, there are often good reasons, he says. One person he met was offered a home so far away he would have had to surrender his full-time job.   Related: Norelle is among scores living in cars and tents in a once-affordable Queensland city. Some are now being forced to leave    Brisbane Youth Service CEO Pam Barker says “homelessness is never a choice”. “As of yesterday, there were no available safe options in temporary accommodation for young people in Brisbane,” she says. “When safe options aren’t available, young people are forced to find the least dangerous alternative – grouping together in public spaces, staying awake all night to avoid harm, or couch-surfing in unsafe environments that put them at high risk of exploitation and further trauma.” Barker said banning tents without providing an alternative only puts homeless kids in greater danger. Walsh is concerned about a race to the bottom, pushing them from one council to another, forcing each in turn to crack down. “The race to the bottom is if we criminalise it, and Moreton Bay has said they’re going to issue fines; Brisbane hasn’t. We don’t know whether that’s true or whether there will be a consequence of fines,” she says. At last count, there were 47,820 people on Queensland’s social housing waiting list. The average wait is two and a half years. • This article was amended on 14 March 2025.

       " 'Cyclone Alfred brought Brisbane’s fourth major flood in 50 years – can the city be flood-proofed? [2025-03-14T23:00:32Z]': 'David and Sheridan Skinner’s old Queenslander near Norman Creek on Brisbane’s south side bears the marks of the city’s floods, going back more than 50 years. The pillars holding up the home show where the water came in 1974, 2011, 2022 and again last week, when ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred dumped more than 274mm of rain in a single day on the flood-prone suburbs and creeks. The property floods regularly, but the couple plans to cancel their flood insurance. They say they don’t need it. About 20 years ago, David and Sheridan raised the weatherboard house about three metres off the ground. Underneath is a car park, plus storage for some tools and a few shelves. Anything valuable can be taken upstairs. “After a flood, just get the Gerni [pressure washer] out as it’s drying off, and clean it off nice and easy,” David says. “We know we flood … we usually call it a spring clean.”     For thousands of Brisbane residents, the past week has brought a familiar anxiety. The rising rivers and creeks flooded many of the same houses as three years ago, and eight years before that.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email  With each flood event, the tricky reality of Brisbane’s geography becomes more clear. Much of the city is built on floodplain and insurance is becoming increasingly unaffordable. But the idea of abandoning large suburbs and communities is, for many, still unthinkable. No-go zones v nimbys After the 2022 floods the state took steps it said would make the city more resilient – not flood-proof, but better able to cope with a climate where flood waters rise with increasing intensity and frequency. That includes designing new builds and modifications to existing homes to better withstand flooding. More than $1bn of state and commonwealth funding has been put toward retrofitting, raising, or buying back homes in flood-prone areas. Andrew Gissing, the chief executive officer of Natural Hazards Research Australia, says while it’s not enough to retrofit every home, it can help reduce insurance premiums in some cases.  “Insurance is clearly an issue being spoken about within the community, it’s a stress,” he says. “Because insurance is based on the risk, these things can ultimately [reduce the risk].” The Queensland government has also been identifying ‘no-go zones’ for future development under an update to regional planning guidelines, but the guidelines are yet to be implemented.    University of Queensland professor of urban planning, Dorina Pojani, says the city ought to undertake a “strategic retreat” from the worst-affected areas.  The state has adopted a buyback scheme, which targets residential land identified as of “extreme” flood risk for conversion from housing. Nicole Bennetts, Queensland and Northern Territory manager for the Planning Institute of Australia, says it was time to talk about what she called “back zoning” more of the city. “It’s a really tricky topic, because it means taking away development rights, or property rights from people that have held property for a long time,” she says. “So within that process, we need to talk about compensation … because it’s not simply planners changing the colour on a map. It has signifiant ramifications, so we need to do it with communities.” In some areas, she says, resilient design is not enough. “Just because we can engineer and plan our way around it, can those occupants get insurance?” Natalie Rayment, the co-founder of Yimby Queensland and director of developer Therefor group, said the city needed to “allow more people to live on good land” by rejecting complaints in high-cost, high-amenity suburbs. “Why should we be blocking everyone else when we’re all sitting here literally high and dry?” she says. The Brisbane City council’s plan for what it calls “urban consolidation” relies on a small number of carefully chosen sites rather than spreading medium-density development through more suburbs. Pojani says the selection criteria often rests more on avoiding community opposition than considering flood risk. It often involves areas that were once industrial estates, such as the Kurilpa development in South Brisbane; a riverfront area which regularly floods. “It’s easy to upzone a place where no one is living, but there might have been a reason why no one was living there historically,” she says. “It might be that people, starting with Indigenous people, and then the earlier settlers, they realise that those areas flood. And that’s why no one went to live there in the first place”. Greater Brisbane urbanists organiser Rob Lucas said restricting development in wealthy suburbs through character protections and a ban on new townhouses  forced new developments into higher-risk areas. “If the council wanted to flood-proof our city, they’d think long and hard about how we get apartments built up in Paddington, Ascot and Highgate Hill as well as down near the river,” he says.    We’ve got a lot of long-term water damage that is really hard to repair.  Siobhan McCafferty     Even the newest estates aren’t free from the risk of flood. The newly built estate of Yarrabilba in Logan – a community of about 12,000 people master-planned by the state government to eventually house about 50,000 – regularly becomes an island when the one road in is cut off. The estate itself has never flooded. Logan mayor Jon Raven says people moving to the area often aren’t aware of the risk. While flood-risk maps for properties are disclosed to new homeowners, the vulnerabilities of the road access may not be as obvious. “They knew it wasn’t flood-proof when they did it,” Raven says. “It runs through some very low-lying areas, very scenic, beautiful low-lying areas along the Logan River.”    Yarrabilba was approved in 2010 and the road plan did not change after the 2011 floods. The developer plans to add two additional exits to the suburb, both of which feed into roads that also get cut off in a flood. Last week the Queensland health department posted paramedics in the community, lest it was cut off. Locals were advised to stockpile about five days’ worth of supplies and that State Emergency Service boats would be used to resupply essentials in case of a longer disaster. “But once you get a lot of people in there – say 20,000 or 30,000 people – you’re not going to be able to use flood boats from SES to take in top-notch supplies,” says Raven.  Under-building Siobhan McCafferty’s home in Wooloongabba flooded in 2022 and again this month. Her house is a traditional Queenslander – a timber home built on posts, designed in part to allow flood water to flow below. Like many similar places over the years, McCafferty’s home was “built under” by a previous owner.   Related: Water, water everywhere: the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Alfred – in pictures    The retrofitted ground floor was “built really shoddily … it’s got a low ceiling, so there’s not a lot of airflow going through, so it’s gonna take two weeks for that to dry out,” she says. “We’ve got a lot of long-term water damage that is really hard to repair.” McCafferty applied for a rebuilding grant after the 2022 floods but was not immediately eligible because the downstairs floor was not up to code. “We’ve got plans to raise the house, but that’s going to cost us three and a half to four hundred thousand dollars,” she says. Gissing says every dollar spent retrofitting, raising or buying-back homes saves $5 in potential response and recovery costs. “South-east Queensland and Northern New South Wales in the last five years have taken a battering of different events,” he says. “And we’re going to see these sorts of things happen more and more into the future.”',\n",
       " 'NSW bans hay imports from south-east Queensland amid fear of fire ants after Cyclone Alfred [2025-03-14T08:29:52Z]': 'New South Wales has temporarily banned the import of hay from parts of south-east Queensland as a precaution against invasive fire ants, which are on the move in large numbers thanks to flooding from ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred. \\nBut the Invasive Species Council said the move is a Band-Aid response and accused the Queensland, NSW and federal governments of dropping the ball in suppressing fire ant numbers within infested areas. \\nOn Friday, the NSW agriculture minister, Tara Moriarty, announced a one-month moratorium on the group biosecurity emergency permit, which allowed hay to be imported to NSW from lower-risk areas within the fire ant biosecurity zone. It followed the release of video by the Invasive Species Council showing multiple large fire ant colonies forming “rafts” to float in flood waters within the Logan River catchment. \\n \\n  Related: Large rafts of invasive fire ants seen floating in flood waters after Cyclone Alfred  \\n \\nMoriarty said farmers in northern NSW were already affected by ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred. “They need our support to get them back on their feet and don’t want a fire ant incursion adding stress and strain to their recovery,” she said. \\n“We have increased surveillance focusing on high-risk areas and are employing advanced tracking and modelling techniques, taking strong preventive measures to stop fire ants.” \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\nJack Gough, the interim CEO of the Invasive Species Council, said the moratorium was a “kneejerk reaction” to the inadequacy of the national fire ant eradication program to suppress numbers within the fire ant biosecurity zone, which includes greater Brisbane, Logan, Ipswich and the Gold Coast. The plan focuses on eradicating fire ant nests from a containment line around the area, and then marching that line inward until all the fire ants are gone. That effort, says Gough, is where “100% of the money is being spent”. \\nA Senate inquiry last year highlighted the failure of the program to also reduce fire ant numbers within the affected are. \\n“If the density is high, the risk of movement is going to be high,” Gough said. \\n \\n Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter \\n \\nSince December 2023, 390 movement declarations have been made for 6,500 tonnes of hay trucked from Queensland into NSW, the NSW Department of Primary Industries said. \\nTim Ford, the managing director of hay and fodder marketplace Feed Central, said the moratorium was a precaution and that no fire ants have ever been found in deliveries of hay. \\n“Is it an overreaction? Probably,” he said. \\n“The fire ants are on the move because of the floods; they have not had time to establish and would need to make their way from the flooded area to the hay shed. There’s so many protections in place to ensure that the fire ants don’t tunnel through hay. It [the moratorium’] would seem a little bit over-zealous at the moment. \\n“There’s no incidents where fire ants have been found in hay. It’s 100% precautionary.” \\nHay is primarily grown in the Lockyer Valley west of Brisbane, parts of which are within the fire ant biosecurity zone, and sold both to other parts of the state and into northern NSW and, depending on the hay type, down as far as Sydney. \\nFord said both growers and buyers in Queensland were well aware of the risk and managed it through proper shedding and tracking. \\n“The growers that are growing hay in fire ant regions are very much on top of it,” he said. \\n“The last thing the fodder industry would ever want is for fire ants to be found in hay.” \\nSouth Australia and western Victoria are experiencing what the Bureau of Meteorology has described as a severe rainfall deficiency, with little pasture left in paddocks and spiking local hay prices. \\nBoth states have biosecurity arrangements in place regarding the import of plant material – including hay and fodder – from within fire ant biosecurity zones. \\nFord said that even in periods of dryness or drought, it rarely makes economic sense to truck hay from Queensland that far south. \\n“Victoria produces 80% of the 10m tonnes of hay grown in Australia each year,” he said. “There’s still hay production in Victoria.” \\nMost of that hay is produced on irrigated river flats in northern Victoria. \\nThe exception is niche products such as Rhodes hay, a low-sugar hay which is sometimes fed to horses and ponies with insulin resistance. Buyers of Rhodes hay should check its providence to see if it’s from a fire ant exclusion zone, Ford said. \\n \\n Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter  \\n',\n",
       " 'Fire ant sting hospitalisations surge post-Cyclone Alfred as reports of first pet death also emerge [2025-03-24T07:53:00Z]': 'Twenty-three people have been hospitalised with serious fire ant stings amid a surge in reports of the invasive pest in the aftermath of Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred and a new $24m package targeting suppression of the insect. The National Fire Ant Eradication Program has received notifications of 60 serious red imported fire ant (Rifa) stings in south-east Queensland since 1 March, with 23 serious enough to warrant hospital care. Separately, a puppy stung to death 15 months ago was reportedly the first pet killed in Queensland by the ants. A program spokesperson said: “Fire ants deliver painful, fiery stings that can cause severe, and sometimes fatal, reactions in humans, pets, and animals,” citing National Allergy Centre of Excellence and Allergy and Anaphylaxis Australia figures that show up to 7.5% of people stung require medical attention. The reported rates of fire ants stings were well above average, said Reece Pianta, the advocacy manager at the Invasive Species Council. Most people stung were doing cyclone clean-up work at the time, he said.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email  “It just shows you what a serious risk fire ants pose to anyone who’s got a job that requires them to go outdoors, or who enjoys bush walking or barbecues on the beach,” he said. “It tells us what the future will be like across the country if fire ant densities grow and spread everywhere.”   Related: Large rafts of invasive fire ants seen floating in flood waters after Cyclone Alfred    The impacts of growing Rifa densities on pets was also becoming clearer, Pianta said. “We are getting a lot of reports of animals having anaphylactic reactions in parks [and] of insect sting events causing animal fatalities,” he said. Fifteen months ago, Ebony Britton’s puppy was found dead on a fire ant nest in Greenbank, near Logan. Pianta said it was the first pet death he could definitively say was caused by fire ants. Pianta said back-to-back flooding events, under-resourcing and inadequate support for property owners was to blame on an “explosion” in fire ant numbers. The council has warned that flood events spread the super-pest. “I can easily think of half a dozen locations south of Brisbane where I can go and see 100 nests right now. That is something that’s changed in the last 18 months.” He said earlier modelling showed that were fire ants to become endemic, 150,000 Australians each year would need medical attention because of fire ants stings. On Monday, the Queensland government announced a $24m boost to Queensland’s Fire Ant Suppression taskforce, which will target 212,000 hectares (523,862 acres) within the region’s suppression zone over the next two years. The Crisafulli government said the treatment would reduce Rifa density in the fire ant suppression zone by up to 80%, focusing on areas along the Logan and Albert rivers and parts of the Scenic Rim, where Rifa densities were highest. The Queensland minister for primary industries, Tony Perrett, said: “We’re hitting fire ants hard in the suppression zone, doubling down on suppression efforts to deal with this destructive pest before it impacts more Queenslanders. “By working with other states and the commonwealth … I am very confident we will be able to prevent a fully fledged invasion.” Pianta said the federal government now needed to match the funds. “That’s why this funding announcement is so timely, and why it is essential that we see a federal commitment about this at the coming election. This is an issue the community is very concerned about in Queensland at the moment,” he said. Rifa are native to South America and are believed to have arrived in Australia via infected materials on ships at the port of Brisbane in 2001 but may have been present in the country since 1992. They are dark reddish-brown with darker abdomens and pose a widespread risk to native wildlife, industry and Australia’s way of life. The pest has now spread to more than 700,000 hectares (1.73m acres) in the Brisbane region and outlier detections have in the past year been found in Oakey, the Sunshine Coast and northern NSW.',\n",

Our hard-earned wisdom and new modular way of existing in the floodplain means that we are always one foot out the door, ready to pack up for higher ground. Mixed feelings bounced around town about those preparing early while the sun was still shining and the river hadn’t yet swelled. Some thought it premature – “Why would I pack up?

The little nuances adapted in response to surviving in this environment. In the houses that have been re-built you will find light switches above the highest tide line, plaster board replaced with villaboard, hooks in ceilings to save precious items, stainless steel kitchens and the avoidance of anything made of chipboard. These small improvements now offer small solace in the face of having to do it all again.  We are facing a new kind of threat: a cyclone. We don’t know cyclones. The combination of being attacked from the sky above and the rising waters beneath our feet is honestly terrifying. Almost 4,000 of our homes where deemed uninhabitable after the 2022 climate disaster. Of these, only 600 have been bought back by the government, with temporary fencing holding down their perimeters to unknown futures, soon to take wind and beat down what little is left of Lismore’s spirit.   Related: Cyclone Alfred live updates: Chalmers expects ‘billions of dollars of damage’ from Alfred; storm slows approach    More than 90,000 sand bags have been collected around the northern rivers. Cars swept by cyclonic swell in Currumbin, there were reports of winds breaking off one of the Big Prawn’s feelers in Ballina, fallen trees have caused blackouts in Byron Bay – and Alfred has not even hit land yet. We are watching dominoes fall on our screens while we still have internet to view it.  Friends who have uprooted their devastated lives in Lismore to start afresh on higher ground, trading community for safety and landing in northern coastal areas, are now fleeing yet again. This time they’re heading south, below where the cyclone is predicted to hit. Back to making difficult decisions based on what is best for their families, abandoning renovations they are in debt for, having invested everything they had and more into a peaceful life that is potentially being ripped away from them once more. New place, different disaster. A friend phoned me this morning for advice. Her dad lives on the same street in South Lismore we moved from after 2022. She can’t get him to prepare, he is dissociated and instead asks where the evacuation centres are set up. He can’t muster the means to move his things up again. Disbelief wins. Another friend turned 30 when the preparation began and posted “thanks for the birthday love”, also pointing out that eight out of the 10 years of her 20s was spent in disaster recovery or preparation in some way. Each disaster makes a thriving future feel less and less realistic. Each disaster steals years and energy we will never get back.

       " 'From sterilising baby bottles to charging laptops, some Australians powered through Cyclone Alfred using EV batteries [2025-03-15T19:00:03Z]': 'When Kat Hickey and her husband talked about what they would do if Tropical Cyclone Alfred knocked out the power in their north Brisbane home, they were more concerned than most. The pair have a nine-month-old daughter and a three-year-old son – having a reliable way to sterilise bottles and boil water for formula was critical. They knew the battery from their white BYD Atto 3 could power their home using the vehicle-to-load system (V2L) – a backup power system that allows the car battery to power appliances – but neither had actually hooked it up. They wondered how much it could handle.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email  When Alfred made landfall and they were among 450,000 homes to lose power, Hickey figured she had nothing to lose. She set to work snaking extension cords through the house as her husband baby-proofed the setup.   Related: ‘A house battery you can drive around’: how some Australians are selling power from their cars back to the grid | Scott Dwyer, Jaime Comber and Kriti Nagrath for the Conversation    Together the couple hooked up a fridge, kettle, toaster, phone chargers, laptop charger and lamp – and then, she says, there was light. “We called the lamp our canary,” she says. “It’s this little lamp that normally sits out of the way, we hardly ever use it. During the storm, it became essential. Whenever we were putting too much stress on the system, it would flicker or turn off completely. “Afterwards, we had to thank it for its service, put it back in the corner, and it hasn’t been used since.”    Social media is filled with EV owners who delight in sharing clever and novel ways to take advantage of their vehicles. People have powered induction cookers and coffee machines when camping, while some drivers use V2L functionality to refuel EVs stranded on the roadside. Not all electric vehicles have V2L capacity – Tesla’s Model Y and Model 3 do not come with the feature – but in the wake of ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred, these systems are again proving their worth as emergency generators in natural disasters. It is not the first time. One woman made headlines in late 2023 when she used her BYD Atto 3 to power her son’s dialysis machine after devastating storms cut power to south-east Queensland. Matt McLaughlin, another EV driver and a member of the Rural Fire Service (RFS), says the destruction caused by Tropical Cyclone Alfred is widespread where he lives in the Gold Coast hinterland. During the storm, a three-tonne tree missed the bed where he and his wife slept by a metre and a half, taking out his deck and crushing his barbecue.   Related: Queensland woman uses electric car to run her son’s dialysis machine during power cut    With power unlikely to be restored for another week at least – a nearby power line was shredded in five places and fallen trees have made much of the area inaccessible – he says his family is doing well thanks to three EVs owned by his wife, his father and himself. “I’m sitting here drinking my tea and charging my laptop,” he says. “The big one is being able to have internet. If you can run your modem on the car, with the NBN doing fibre to the home now, you have communications, which is important because with the towers down there’s just no mobile phone reception out here.” With each battery in the two BYDs and the MG carrying 60kWh capacity – more than the 10kWh offered by a Tesla power wall – McLaughlin says these “batteries on wheels” mean they could keep the lights on for a month. His work with the RFS has only highlighted the significance of this in recent days. “On the weekend, we came across really elderly people trapped in their house: no power, trees on the driveway, no phones, no communications. They’re saying: ‘Is the power coming back on soon? All our food’s gone off,’” McLaughlin says. “So we’re doing welfare checks; we’re having to go back.”    It is this sort of situation that has prompted MyCar (formerly Kmart Tyre and Auto) to trial a program where EV drivers can register to help out during disaster recovery. So far more 100 people have registered with “The Chargers”, a program that, when activated, sends a text message alert to those within 250km to be on standby to help out with further details to follow. Adele Coswello, chief customer officer at MyCar, says the company coordinated with Energex and relief groups to support evacuation and community centres where needed on Thursday and Friday. “Our research showed that three-quarters of Australians have experienced a power outage as a result of natural disasters,” Coswello says. “One mother told us she felt vulnerable going to sleep because her baby monitor wasn’t working.” Though Alfred did not cause the level of destruction some feared, Hickey says the experience has made her car “that much more valuable” to her.   Related: Electric v hybrid: which vehicle should you buy in 2025?    “I’m gradually converting my friends,” she says. “I have a friend who [is] a chemical engineer and used to work for one of those offshore rigs and even he’s in the pre-contemplation phase of having the next car be an EV.” Any doubts she may have had about going electric are gone, she says, and she’s now thinking about long-term plans for swapping out their gas cooker for induction, a battery for their home solar panels as insurance, and potentially, electric hot water. “It’s so amazing,” she says. “Next time I might try other things, see how far we can push the canary by plugging in things like the washing machine.”',\n",
       " 'LNP denies using ‘cover’ of Tropical Cyclone Alfred to scrap independent review of mining lease objections [2025-03-12T07:33:07Z]': 'Queensland’s government has denied using the “cover” of Tropical Cyclone Alfred to cancel a long-running review of the way objections to mining leases are handled by the state land court. The Queensland Law Reform Commission had been conducting the independent review since June 2023, with recommendations due on 30 June. On 4 March, with the cyclone bearing down on the state, the attorney general, Deb Frecklington, cancelled its reference, ending the process. The opposition leader, Steven Miles, accused the government of “sneaking through these changes while the south-east is bunkered down under the cover of a cyclone warning”.   Related: LNP release of Queensland corruption watchdog report ‘terrifying and petty’, Jackie Trad says    “That this is a calculated manoeuvre by the attorney general and the LNP to govern in secret,” he said on Wednesday.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email  Frecklington denied she had done so, saying she’d had “a conversation with the chair of QLRC” on 25 February, to arrange a date to cancel the review. The independent law reform body will be replaced by the cabinet resources committee, which is made up of senior members of the LNP government. It is made up of government ministers for resources Dale Last, environment Andrew Powell plus treasurer David Janetzki and deputy premier Jarrod Bleijie. According to the minister’s letter cancelling the review, the new committee will consider initiatives designed to “improve the competitiveness of Queensland’s resources sector and the value of its supply chain”, such as by reducing delays and improving approval timeframes. The QLRC had been commissioned with designing amendments that would provide “the fairness, efficiency and effectiveness of the objections processes” and “providing opportunities for community participation, including access to justice and the cost of participating” among others. Labor has also accused the government of using the “cover” of the cyclone to “secretly” sack an advisory body designed to respond to youth crime. The deputy opposition leader, Cameron Dick, said the premier, David Crisafulli, had “cynically used the cover of Cyclone Alfred to pop the dirty laundry out as cyclone Alfred approached the Queensland coast”. Frecklington said “Labor’s Independent Ministerial Advisory Committee” would be replaced by their minister for victims and a new advisory body, and its members had been offered positions elsewhere in government. It was advised of its closure on 25 February. Community action group Lock the Gate Alliance said they were “shocked” at the “unprecedented step” to cancel the independent review of mining lease objections, which they claimed was done in order to prevent the release of its findings. They compared the move with legislation passed by the government of Campbell Newman to reduce standing for objectors to resource projects. “We can only conclude that the LNP government has intervened because the findings were not popular with the mining industry,” the Lock the Gate Alliance national coordinator, Ellen Roberts, said. According to a list of draft recommendations, QLRC was considering recommending amending legislation to facilitate independent expert advice and requiring decision makers to consider “any independent expect advice received”. It was also recommending “requiring decision-makers to consider the rights of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples when deciding a mining lease application and associated environmental authority”. Andrew Kwan, managing lawyer at the Environmental Defenders Office in Queensland, said the resources cabinet committee didn’t allow for input by “Queenslanders adversely affected by mining who made submissions to the Qlrc”. He said the move “devalues the work of not just QLRC staff but the hundreds of community and industry stakeholders who earnestly participated in this extensive review”. The LNP also plans to increase regulation on renewables projects, keep the state’s coal plants operating longer and repeal its renewables target. “Although disappointed we cannot finalise this work, we respect this is a matter for the Attorney-General,” Qlrc chair, Fleur Kingham, said.',\n",
       " 'How to prepare for Cyclone Alfred and what to do if it’s too late to leave [2025-03-04T23:35:25Z]': 'Tropical Cyclone Alfred is predicted to make landfall anywhere between Brisbane and Sunshine Coast this week. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has warned it may bring severe hazards and “dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding”. So, how do you prepare for a cyclone – and what do you do if it’s too late to leave? How to prepare for a cyclone Your starting point is to consider the risk to yourself and everyone in your household (including pets). Consider ensuring you have:  non-perishable food that everyone in the family will eat (enough for five to seven days) water for drinking and cleaning (three litres per person per day) medication (two weeks worth) toiletries and first aid kit pet food/supplies torches batteries a back-up battery for your phone baby formula and nappies if needed protective clothing and closed-in shoes cash in small denominations valuable documents such as passports, title deeds, ID, insurance details, photos (these can be photographed or packed in weather-proof container or envelope) kids’ books, card games, board games, headphones anything else you may need or really value (and isn’t too heavy to carry).  Make sure you have a grab-and-go kit that you can carry by yourself if authorities suddenly tell you to evacuate immediately.   Related: Tropical Cyclone Alfred: 20,000 Brisbane homes could be flooded    Conventional wisdom used to be to prepare enough supplies for three days of disruption. Now, experts recommend having enough for five to seven days. After the initial disaster there may be road blockages or supply chain problems. Ensure you have enough medication for a week or two, because pharmacies may take days or weeks to reopen. And remember that many medications, such as insulin, need to be refrigerated, so consider how you’d keep them cool if the power went out. Fill containers with water and stick them in your freezer now; they can keep your freezer cool if you lose power. They can also become drinking water in future. Talk to your neighbours. Do they have a generator or a camping fridge you can use? This is a great opportunity to get to know your community and pool your resources. Ask yourself if you have friends with whom you or a pet can stay. One of the main reasons people don’t evacuate is because they can’t bring their pets (not all evacuation shelters allow them, so check in advance). Consider what you can do now to prepare your house. One of the most common call-outs the SES receives is about blocked drains and gutters, so check if there’s time to clean your gutters now. You won’t be able to do it during the storm. Stay informed – and don’t rely on hearsay Have a plan for getting truthful information before, during and after the cyclone. Rely on the information provided by official sources, as they will tell you when it’s too late to evacuate or when it’s safe to come out. This is highly context-specific and will depend on where you are located. Get advice where possible from your local council’s disaster dashboard (most councils have one). It should provide information such as where to get sandbags, which roads are closed (which can affect your evacuation plan) and evacuation centre openings and locations. Anyone who monitors social media will see how many amateur meteorologists and maps are out there, but these are often not the best source. Always rely on official sources rather than hearsay, trending footage or amateur “experts”. Always have an battery-operated AM-FM radio. If power goes out, relying on your phone to track information will drain your phone battery very quickly.   Related: Alice thought Brisbane wouldn’t flood twice in one decade. Now she’s bracing for Tropical Cyclone Alfred to hit    You may be able to charge it via your car or laptop, but telecommunications networks may not be active. So having a battery-operated radio on hand – and plenty of batteries – is crucial. What if the cyclone hits while you’re at home? If it’s too late to evacuate, have a plan for sheltering in place. Find the smallest room in your house with the least windows (which can shatter in a storm). This is often the bathroom, but it could be under the stairs. It is usually on the lowest level of the house. Bring your food, water, radio, blankets and supplies there. Avoid walking around the house during the cyclone to fetch things; there could be glass on the floor or debris flying around. It’s hard to predict how long you will need to shelter there but it’s important not to leave until official sources say it is safe to do so. Cyclones come in stages. They arrive from one direction, then comes an eerie calm as the “eye of the storm” passes over. Next, the other half of the cyclone arrives. Don’t go outside during the eye of the storm, because it’s not over. Outside the house, there may be power lines down, broken glass and other hazards. Don’t venture out until you get official clearance from the disaster dashboard or official sources on the radio saying it is safe. For non-life threatening emergencies – such as a tree on your roof, or water running through your house – call the SES on 132 500 or register on the SES Assistance app (if you’re in Queensland). They will not come during the event itself but will come later. If it’s a life-threatening emergency, always call triple 0. After the storm After the storm, consider how to make your house more cyclone-ready in future. Many houses in north Queensland are designed for cyclone zones, but not as many further south will be. Climate change means cyclones are likely to be more severe in future. These days, be cyclone-ready 365 days a year.

       " '‘I need to survive’: rower attempting to cross Pacific activates emergency beacon off Queensland near Cyclone Alfred [2025-03-02T04:10:09Z]': 'A Royal Australian Navy ship is bound for the Coral Sea after a Lithuanian man attempting to row across the Pacific Ocean from San Diego to Brisbane got into trouble. Aurimas Mockus activated his emergency beacon on Friday night about 740km east of Mackay, Queensland, and 90km west of Tropical Cyclone Alfred. He is travelling solo on the rowing boat from the Californian city to Brisbane and was battling winds up to 100km/h and heavy seas up to seven metres on Sunday, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) said. Mockus departed the US in mid-October 2024. On Sunday afternoon, an Amsa spokesperson said the agency had communicated with Mockus through an interpreter via its Challenger rescue plane. Mockus reported he had no major injuries.   Related: Aurimas Mockus has been rowing across the Pacific for months. Now he’s weeks from Australia – if he can avoid Cyclone Alfred    The Cairns-based Challenger jet didn’t spot his vessel on Saturday but managed to make contact with Mockus then. He said he was tired. Another aircraft was sent from Royal Australian Air Force Base Edinburgh near Adelaide. HMAS Choules, a 16,000-tonne navy landing ship, was en route from Brisbane to the Coral Sea to assist. Amsa said the ship was expected to reach Mockus by Monday morning. Images taken by an RAAF aircraft showed the tiny vessel rolling on massive waves in the Coral Sea.    On Thursday, Mockus said that rowing was “out of the question – I need to survive”. By that evening, he told his team that he was in “God’s hands” and that the coming days were “crucial”. “Last night was utterly sleepless, but with immense effort I successfully navigated around the Chesterfield Islands’ reefs. From here on it’s in God’s hands. The most important thing is to endure the next few days – they will be crucial,” he said. “Right now, I’m being carried at a very high speed, but not yet in the direction I need. I’m drifting a bit too far west – toward the approaching typhoon [cyclone]. “I hope the north wind will allow me to escape the typhoon (pushing me downward) as the drift is already massive – I don’t need to row. There are 500 nautical miles left if I manage to row directly toward Brisbane. But that’s hard to say because the typhoon is waiting ahead. “There’s no sun out in the ocean, so I must conserve my battery power as much as possible – I’ve already reached a critical limit. I’ve shut down everything I can, leaving only the ability to communicate with my shore team. I just spoke with them, and they had nothing reassuring to say – I must endure this wind.” Mockus’s team had not provided a further update by Sunday afternoon. Amsa said on Sunday afternoon that weather conditions had eased slightly, “however, the area is still within the influence of Tropical Cyclone Alfred with winds up to 100km/h and 5-7 metre seas”.   Interactive   The cyclone was about 500km east of Rockhampton on Sunday. The category two cyclone was forecast to move south, roughly parallel to the coastline, before weakening slightly and moving to the south-east on Monday. It was then expected to slow and turn west from Tuesday, travelling back towards the southern Queensland coast. The Bureau of Meteorology said strong to gale-force winds could impact K’gari – also known as Fraser Island – on Sunday. If Mockus makes it to Queensland, he would be the first person to row across the Pacific on this particular route, he has said. If he reached Australia in less than 22 days from Sunday he would set a new Guinness record. A small group of people have crossed the Pacific single-handed, including the Britons Peter Bird in 1983 and John Beeden in 2015, and the Australian Michelle Lee in 2023. Also in 2023, 24-year-old Tom Robinson attempted the feat but was rescued by a cruise ship after his boat capsized. In 2020, the Paralympic rowing star Angela Madsen died while attempting a solo journey from California to Hawaii.',\n",

       " 'Alice thought Brisbane wouldn’t flood twice in one decade. Now she’s bracing for Tropical Cyclone Alfred to hit [2025-03-04T14:00:06Z]': 'One month ago, when Alice Dent moved into her bottom-floor riverfront unit in the Brisbane suburb of Toowong, she told herself the city couldn’t possibly flood twice in the same decade. \\nBut with category-two Tropical Cyclone Alfred bearing down on the city, the university student is having second thoughts. Like thousands of Brisbane residents, Dent spent Tuesday morning at a sandbag depot getting ready for inundation. \\nWith its first five sandbag sites facing huge demand, the Brisbane city council opened four additional depots on Tuesday. But there was still a two-hour wait at the Toowong site, a former bowls club – and elsewhere, others queued for even longer. \\n“I think everyone’s pretty traumatised from ’22, like everyone remembers it very vividly – I don’t think anyone wants a repeat of that,” Dent says, referring to 2022, when parts of New South Wales and Queensland – including Brisbane – were hit by flooding. \\nDent received some advice from a friends’ mum – Margaret Cook, a historian of Brisbane floods – through Facebook. “She said it’s probably going to flood, and even if not, it’s always best to be prepared,” Dent says. \\n \\n  Related: ‘Be prepared’: Tropical Cyclone Alfred changes direction and heads towards Queensland coast  \\n \\nAfter 12 days heading south, Tropical Cyclone Alfred executed a dramatic right turn on Tuesday afternoon as predicted.

Instead, they lined up for hours to gather supplies for their neighbours, children, parents or friends unable to help themselves. \\nNicky Haesler and Billy Fogarty gathered sandbags for their downstairs neighbour. They live in the upstairs of a Queenslander in the Brisbane suburb of Red Hill and expect to stay dry. \\n“His house floods every time that it rains,” Haesler says. “We have contingency plans if he needs to come upstairs while his place gets flooded. But hopefully this helps.” \\nPeter and Maggie Castle, English migrants in their 70s, spent Tuesday helping their daughter prepare her home in Bulimba, another Brisbane suburb. \\n“The property is slightly raised, [but] underneath there’s a garage and various other things, all the electrics,” Peter says. “So obviously she was very concerned that it needed to be done as quickly as possible.” \\nJosh Humphrey, who was gathering sandbags at the Whites Hill Reserve depot in Brisbane’s Camp Hill to help protect his parents’ place, believes this time could be as bad as 2022. \\n“The water was still flowing out, even though the tide was supposed to be coming in,” he says, describing sitting at the river on Tuesday morning at the low-tide change. “We saw that and said, well, here comes 2022 again, because it was exactly the same way that it started.” \\nRead more of Guardian Australia’s Tropical Cyclone Alfred coverage: \\n \\n Tropical Cyclone Alfred LIVE: latest news and updates \\n When and where is Cyclone Alfred likely to make landfall? \\n Why did Tropical Cyclone Alfred slow down on its path towards the east coast? \\n What we know so far about TC Alfred \\n How to prepare for a cyclone \\n Brisbane flood map: suburbs at risk \\n Is climate change supercharging Tropical Cyclone Alfred as it powers towards Australia?  \\n',\n",
       " 'David Crisafulli came out of Cyclone Alfred looking like a leader. His real danger lies within the LNP [2025-03-13T14:00:06Z]': 'There was something different about David Crisafulli – even if it wasn’t immediately clear what had changed – as the Queensland premier addressed the state about the looming threat from Tropical Cyclone Alfred. Leading through a natural disaster is a rite of passage for a Queensland leader. There’s also little anyone can do to prepare. It’s a brutal “learn on the job” experience that requires difficult calls with imperfect information. Handled the right way – with calm and sincerity, the right ratios of strength and compassion – the experience can define a premier. Floundering politicians have walked out of the briefing room at the emergency services complex at Kedron as beloved leaders.   Related: LNP denies using ‘cover’ of Tropical Cyclone Alfred to scrap independent review of mining lease objections    Anna Bligh’s popularity climbed 35 points after the 2011 Brisbane floods. Her tearful “we are Queenslanders” address is still talked about by, as she put it then, “the people they breed tough north of the border”. Crisafulli appears to have a natural effect in these situations that his predecessor, Steven Miles, only found too late in last year’s nothing-to-lose election state campaign. Miles’s first task as premier was to lead the response to Tropical Cyclone Jasper in north Queensland. There was little to fault in that response, but the lack of emotion or animation meant there was little to remember about it either. As Tropical Cyclone Alfred approached, Crisafulli had a few missteps. His comments that people should stock up on canned food and bottled water might have contributed to some of the panic buying in the early part of last week, when even Heinz and San Pellegrino were stripped from the shelves.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email  And the response itself left questions about the state’s disaster management. People in Hervey Bay say they were not prepared for flooding that hit the town. Residents near Brisbane’s suburban creeks were sent “emergency alerts” by police about potential flash flooding on Monday morning, several hours after the creek heights had peaked. While the premier’s office has sought to portray his approach as a break from Covid-era edicts – a champion of devolved decision-making and personal responsibility – the reality is more nuanced. The government closed the schools on Thursday and then gave those able the green light to reopen on Monday. The idea this is radically different to past approaches is simply untrue. Regardless, Crisafulli is a premier with an enhanced personal brand after Alfred. He has been lauded for having a rare characteristic prized by leaders – the ability to speak with authority and authenticity at the same time. But there was also something else that contributed to the sense that Crisafulli had a strong week. Something that wasn’t clear until Wednesday, when parliament resumed, and the premier’s sidekick, the deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, returned to his hip.   Related: Large rafts of invasive fire ants seen floating in flood waters after Cyclone Alfred    Bleijie is becoming increasingly influential in the LNP’s first Queensland government in a decade. He is a politician with a compulsive fighting instinct and comes across as brash. In parliament this week, Bleijie stood up and made truck honking noises. The deputy premier also has close control over the LNP’s parliamentary strategy, which has at times appeared to focus on gleefully battering political opponents rather than governing with anything resembling maturity. Behind the scenes, moderates say the deputy premier’s instincts risk running the government into unnecessary trouble. The partnership between Crisafulli and Bleijie is central to harmony between the LNP’s once-warring factions. Crisafulli’s closest allies are moderates (though he stays out of much of the internal politicking). Insiders say Bleijie and his allies are instigating policy fights the government would be better advised to avoid. Crisafulli key to re-election in 2028 is to show the public – especially Brisbane voters who have been wary of the LNP since Campbell Newman – a different sort of conservative government. And it has not gone unnoticed, especially within LNP ranks, that Crisafulli has amplified his personal appeal this week with what is being viewed as mature management of the emergency response, with his attack dog mostly absent from his side.',\n",

Tens of thousands of people in two states have lost power, as damaging winds, huge waves and heavy rainfall from the approaching Tropical Cyclone Alfred begin to batter coastal communities. Forecasters said Alfred may make a “prolonged” coastal crossing, as the category two storm moved slowly towards landfall in south-east Queensland.

       " 'As Trump attacks US science agencies, ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred ushers in a fresh wave of climate denial in Australia | Adam Morton [2025-03-11T00:41:28Z]': 'It’s not a good time for climate science. The Trump administration has sacked more than a thousand staff from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the country’s leading agency for weather forecasting and climate science, potentially damaging its ability to do lifesaving work forecasting hurricanes and other extreme weather events. The New York Times reported plans are under way to fire another 1,000. If true, that will take the cuts to about 20% of the workforce. On Monday, it was announced Nasa was axing its chief scientist, Katherine Calvin, who had been appointed to lead the agency’s work on climate change. In trademark Donald Trump/Elon Musk style, there appears little care or sense in where cuts have been made. It’s destruction for destruction’s sake, with tens of thousands of peer-reviewed scientific papers underpinning the understanding of climate science dismissed as a “hoax” or, somehow, “woke”. As in most areas, what happens in the US on forecasting and science capability will have an impact beyond its borders. In Australia, the past week has seen a fresh wave of climate denial as ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred approached and hit the southern Queensland coast. News Corp outlets, in particular, have run straw man arguments attacking people that have forcefully linked the storm to the climate crisis.   Related: The fact that humans can only survive on Earth doesn’t bother Trump – and I know why | George Monbiot    Some commentators have pointed out that southern Queensland has had cyclones before. Others have suggested there is uncertainty in the data about the pace and way in which they are changing, and that climate change didn’t “cause” Alfred. Well, yes. That’s all correct, of course, but hardly the point. What they mostly haven’t said is that the ocean and atmosphere are demonstrably warmer than even just a few years ago. Or that this means the most intense storms formed in warmer conditions carry more energy and more water. Or that the conditions under which tropical cyclones can form are moving south as the planet heats up. Tropical cyclones can take shape when the sea is 26.5C. Temperatures at that level are not enough for a cyclone to form – a range of climatic conditions have to occur – but they are being reached and sustained more often in places further away from the equator. As the cliche goes, the dice are increasingly loaded towards an extreme event being worse than in the past. We have loaded the dice by burning fossil fuels in greater and greater quantities. They have been the primary driver of a more than 50% increase in the amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since pre-industrial times. The evidence is that this is making tropical cyclones less frequent but more intense. There is data suggesting they also tend to last longer. Greater intensity plus time equals heightened risk of damage and casualties. It doesn’t mean that every cyclone or extreme storm will be more damaging than in the past. It does mean that when one comes, the potential for it to carry enough energy to wreak significant havoc is rising, not falling.    Debate over the climate crisis can seem stuck in an eternal bad faith rut    The extra energy in a cyclone has a number. Nearly 200 years ago, physicists found that if air warms by 1C it can hold about 7% more water vapour and dump more rain. It has proven remarkably correct. What they didn’t know is that it was only part of the story – that in the case of some particularly strong storms in a warmer climate there are further multiplying factors in the atmosphere that can increase their power and lead to a 30-40% increase in localised rainfall intensity. Yes, due to climate change. Pointing this out isn’t a “political lecture”, as the Liberal National party senator Matt Canavan suggested last week. Nor is a form of hysteria or an expression of religious belief, as an overexcited Sky News commentator claimed. It is highlighting facts that are relevant to how we might prepare for what lies ahead. This might all feel like a statement of the painfully obvious, given the years of scientific inquiry and reporting. For those who feel that way: I hear you. Debate over the climate crisis can seem stuck in an eternal bad faith rut, even as attempts across the community to address it speed up. But let’s consider some more facts. If you’re after a clear picture on the physical science you could do worse than listen to Prof Mark Howden, the director of the Australian National University’s Institute for Climate, Energy &amp; Disaster Solutions and a vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In a state of the climate address last month – his final in the role before stepping down later this year – he set out an extraordinary list of evidence. Some of it is reasonably well known. Best we can tell, global CO2 emissions still increased last year – by 0.8%. If we want to put an optimistic spin on it we might describe this as basically flatlining. But they’re not coming down yet.   Related: Alfred may have blown Albanese’s election plans off course, but now the PM can show he has the common touch    Some of it is less well understood. Particularly: there had been a “massive step-change up” in warming since June 2023, when temperatures vaulted well beyond what was already a historically high level. Scientists don’t exactly know why this happened. Howden described the past 18 months as “mind-boggling” and “like more than a decade of temperature increase in two years”. Scientists do know the past decade has been the hottest 10 years on record. They do know that, averaged across the globe, every day in 2024 was at least 1.25C hotter than pre-industrial levels, and three quarters were 1.5C hotter. And they do know feedback loops are making things worse. Howden gave two examples: melting of Arctic ice and tundra and massive wildfires. Both release large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, worsening the climate crisis, which in turn make large-scale melting and burning more likely. And so on. Howden made a couple of overarching points. One was a barely veiled message for the political class, and perhaps those charged with holding them to account. He said that Australia had the resources and means to become a global leader in zero-emissions solutions if it had the will, but stressed: “We have to put to bed this idea that we’re tracking OK and having some aspirational target of net zero by 2050 will somehow make us avoid 1.5C [of heating above pre-industrial levels].” The second wasn’t directed at the columnists and coal bosses who would use Alfred as the latest front in an ideological war, but could have been. “If this isn’t certain enough,” Howden asked, “how much certainty do you need? What’s the evidence base that tips you over into taking this seriously?” Good question.  Adam Morton is Guardian Australia’s climate and environment editor ',\n",
       " 'Gold Coast residents told to ‘take shelter now’ as NSW authorities search for man missing in Cyclone Alfred flood waters [2025-03-07T18:01:35Z]': 'Millions of people are sheltering from Tropical Cyclone Alfred as it crashes into the coast of south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales bringing destructive winds and heavy rain. The slow-moving weather system was finally expected to make landfall after speeding up overnight on Friday and into Saturday morning as it moved towards Brisbane. The storm was downgraded to a category one as it crossed North Stradbroke Island late on Friday night and headed into Moreton Bay. The latest update from the Bureau of Meteorology was that it would make landfall around Bribie Island north of Brisbane on Saturday morning and drop to a tropical low system before heading inland.   Related: Cyclone Alfred live updates: Brisbane, Queensland and NSW BoM path tracking map; landfall time and category; weather forecasts TC Alfred rain and flooding warnings –\\xa0latest Australia news    Destructive wind gusts of up to 150km/h are possible around the exposed island coasts and coastal locations. At 3am AEST Alfred was 50km north-north-east of Brisbane and 100km north of Gold Coast, according to the bureau. Residents in Brisbane were advised by the city council to take shelter, while people in parts of the Northern Rivers of NSW were told to seek higher ground because of the risk from flooding. Gold Coast residents have been urged to stay home and “take shelter”, potentially for days, in a string of alerts from Broadbeach to Jacob Well and South Stradbroke Island.  As a search continued for a man washed into flood waters in northern New South Wales, more than 200,000 homes in Queensland and NSW were without power on Friday evening as Tropical Cyclone Alfred crawled towards the coast. Telecommunications were also knocked out for many. Energex, south-east Queensland’s electricity distribution network provider, said there were 227,000 customers affected by outages in the region. “The slow-moving system is actually worse for our city,” the Gold Coast acting mayor, Donna Gates, said.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email  “It increases the risk of heavy rain over an extended period. So this again is a concern in relation to flooding.” A string of emergency warnings were sent out on Friday afternoon. Emergency alerts were issued for the entire Redland city area, and in the Gold Coast from Broadbeach to Jacobs Well and South Stradbroke Island. An alert issued by the Redland city council for islands in Moreton Bay ordered residents to “take shelter now in the strongest part of the building you are in”. Meanwhile, thousands of people in parts of the NSW northern rivers were told to leave their homes on Thursday night, including residents in Lismore’s CBD, north and south. The community was devastated by flooding in 2022.  A man is missing after his four-wheel-drive was washed off a bridge by fast-moving flood waters north-east of Dorrigo in northern NSW on Friday afternoon. He left the car and secured himself to a tree but was swept away about 3pm, NSW police said. He is still missing. The Queensland premier, David Crisafulli, said there had been rainfall totals of about 200mm in the last 24 hours in some parts of south-east Queensland and much more was expected. Major flood warnings have been issued for the Logan and Albert rivers. Expected rainfall totals over 24 hours are upward of 300mm to 400mm as the system crosses. The acting Queensland police commissioner, Shane Chelepy, said there had not yet been loss of life or missing persons in Queensland. Some Gold Coast suburbs have lost telecommunication coverage after 26 mobile base stations lost power and ran out of battery, he said. Those locations include Bilinga, Bilinga North, Binna Burra, Burleigh Waters, Coolangatta, O’Reilly’s, Parkwood, Bundle, Reedy Creek, Mudgeeraba, Karumba and Springbrook.   Related: Tropical Cyclone Alfred approaches the Queensland coast – in pictures    “The moment it is safe to do so, our telcos, which we have been engaged with, will get into those errors and try to get generation to those stations,” he said. Matthew Collopy, a senior forecaster with the bureau, said Alfred would most likely cross the mainland coast as a category 1 cyclone. “Destructive wind gusts up to 150km/h are possible about the exposed island coasts and coastal locations near and to the south of the system,” he said. “As the cyclone moves across Moreton Bay islands, it is expected to weaken from a category 2 to a category 1 system. That will mean that destructive winds are unlikely for Brisbane itself, but damaging wind gusts to 120km/h are expected and they will develop quickly as the system approaches.” Flood watches remain in place from the Mary River through Sunshine Coast creeks and rivers, the Pine and Caboolture rivers, Gold Coast creeks and rivers, as well as the upper and lower Brisbane and the Condamine, McIntyre and Weir rivers.

       " 'Aurimas Mockus has been rowing across the Pacific for months. Now he’s weeks from Australia – if he can avoid Cyclone Alfred [2025-02-25T14:00:17Z]': 'For four months Aurimas Mockus has been alone at sea. Surviving on dried food and rowing an average of 12 hours a day, he has battled blisters and unfavourable winds. Now, just 12 or so days from Australian shores, the 44-year-old Lithuanian has encountered a new problem: avoiding the centre of Tropical Cyclone Alfred, which has been intensifying over the Coral Sea. The rower is on day 133 of his 12,000km journey from San Diego to Brisbane in a single-seater ocean rowing boat. If he makes it to Queensland, Mockus will be the first person to row across the Pacific on this particular route, he says. And if he reaches Australia in less than 26 days he will set a new Guinness record.  Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email  But the past two weeks have been difficult. Mockus has been stuck in a whirlpool, pushed off route and forced to paddle north when he’d wanted to head south. His team is now warning of the “powerful typhoon” forming that could “upset all plans”. Reefs, winds and whirlpools In January, Mockus crossed the equator and entered the final third of his route. “I am approaching the part of the route where I must navigate between large, expansive islands with dangerous reefs,” he said in a media release at the time. “This part of the route may also be subject to headwinds, strong crosswinds, emerging eddies, tornadoes and mixing currents.”   Interactive   Calculating his trajectory according to weather conditions was critical. “God only knows what awaits me when I reach a challenging part of the route and what pace I can maintain,” he said. Mockus’s original plan was to take advantage of a three-day window of calm to move further south and turn towards Brisbane, his team said in a media release on Monday. But an earlier typhoon, he said, had carried him off course toward islands and he had to drop his parachute anchor to slow his progress. When winds died down, he started paddling against the current. “I knew that my time to manoeuvre was limited,” he said.   Related: ‘Like a zombie’: Aurimas Mockus and his gruelling quest to row from San Diego to Brisbane – mostly naked    “The strain on my body was immense – old calluses ruptured, and new ones appeared. But I knew I had to move forward.” The next night he was caught in a strong whirlpool that carried the boat. It wasn’t until the next morning that winds died down enough for him to continue paddling. “I felt that my progress was slow, but I had a goal, and I knew that 20 nautical miles away there would be a current in my favour,” he said. “Weak but favourable.”    Except the weather changed again, and the wind carried him sideways. “I dropped my parachute anchor and contacted my shore team.” The planned three-day calm window was now only two hours, making a manoeuvre south impossible. Mockus decided to turn around and head north – “ie, back”. “It was painful because trying to take the southern route cost a lot of energy, but I knew I had done everything possible,” he said. He pulled out the parachute anchor and began paddling north. Getting to the Coral Sea involved reaching New Caledonia, making a turn and crossing the island’s reef gorge. Mockus was able to take advantage of a favourably strong wind and current, his team said in a media release. But now he must avoid another impending cyclone which covers most of the Coral Sea.    Avoiding the centre of the storm On Monday evening, Mockus said the current was carrying him towards the reefs in the centre of the Coral Sea. His shore team told him to drop his parachute anchor because Tropical Cyclone Alfred was intensifying and the situation was “becoming more complex”.  By Wednesday morning, the Bureau of Meteorology had graded Alfred a category-two storm. “I will feel the impact of the typhoon most strongly on Wednesday,” Mockus said . “The winds will be unpredictable, but it is already clear that they will be at record speeds, unlike anything experienced on this journey so far.” He anticipates waves of about three metres, “intense and sharp”. His plan is to “get into the typhoon’s tail” and take advantage of the wind to reach Brisbane. But while strong winds may give Mockus “a good push forward”, being near the typhoon’s centre would be dangerous, with wind speeds up to 50 knots. Navigating reefs as he heads further south will also prove difficult. “[Winds] absolutely whistle around the centre of the tropical cyclone,” the bureau said on Monday. Mockus’s team said: “Still, he is ready to tackle these challenges as the finish is just around the corner.” On Tuesday morning, Mockus said he spent most of the day with his parachute anchor dropped, but he then revised that plan.  “I have decided to go all in,” he said. “I’ll navigate around the reefs from the north. I hope I won’t run into the hurricane, though it’s moving back and forth in the Coral Sea, making it hard to predict anything with certainty.” The alternative, he said, was to stay in one place, but “waiting is psychologically too tricky for me”. “So, I’m going all in – I’m heading toward the hurricane. “If it moves toward me, I’ll drop the parachute anchor behind the islands and reefs.” Mockus has been paddling about 70 nautical miles a day – “cosmically high,” he said in January. Before this journey, he had never rowed. He set up his boat almost from scratch – buying only the hull and instruments. He also had to learn proper rowing techniques. Along the way, he has been followed by dolphins and sharks. In a few instances, he could not enter the water to clean the bottom of his boat due to a shark swimming nearby. He has also encountered whales, and a bird who tried to swoop into his boat and snatch a fish he caught. Homesickness has also been a constant companion. He said he cannot wait to hug his family when he arrives in Australia. Part of his motivation was to draw attention to the conflict in Ukraine, having previously raised funds to support Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, and transported humanitarian aid to the war zone, according to his website. “I know it won’t be easy, but it’s not easy for the people who defend their country either, so I wanted to dedicate my rowing to Ukrainians,” he said in an email in November 2024.    “I decided to remind the world that the war is not over.” When Mockus reaches Brisbane, he will join a small group who have crossed the Pacific single-handed, including the Britons Peter Bird in 1983 and John Beeden in 2015, and the Australian Michelle Lee in 2023. In 2023, 24-year-old Tom Robinson attempted the feat but was rescued by a cruise ship after his boat capsized. In 2020, the Paralympic rowing star Angela Madsen died while attempting a solo journey from California to Hawaii.',\n",
       " 'What we know so far about Tropical Cyclone Alfred: when and where it will hit, school closures, category now and suburbs at risk [2025-03-07T05:07:06Z]': 'On Friday morning, meteorologists mapping the trajectory of Tropical Cyclone Alfred were predicting it would make landfall either Friday night or Saturday morning somewhere between Noosa and Coolangatta. The most recent tracking map suggested it could cross north of Brisbane. \\nAlfred’s slow progress to the mainland could prolong already severe conditions to the south of its projected path, particularly in parts of the Gold Coast and northern New South Wales. \\n \\n  Related: Cyclone Alfred live updates: Brisbane, Queensland and NSW BoM path tracking map; landfall time and category; weather forecasts TC Alfred rain and flooding warnings –&nbsp;latest Australia news  \\n \\nThousands of people in parts of the NSW Northern Rivers were told to leave their homes on Thursday night, including residents in Lismore’s CBD, north and south. Evacuation orders were issued as far south as the Nambucca shire, more than 400km south of the Queensland-NSW border. \\nThe NSW State Emergency Service warned people in 11 locations to evacuate before 9pm on Thursday: Uki, Fingal Heads and Tumbulgum in the Tweed catchment; North Lismore, South Lismore, Lismore CBD and East Lismore in the Lismore catchment; Bungawalbin and low-lying parts of Kyogle and Coraki in the Richmond catchment; and Billinudgel in the Brunswick catchment. \\nQueensland police warned people on the Gold Coast to prepare to take shelter on Thursday night. \\nAuthorities in Brisbane said 20,000 properties in the city were at risk of inundation from a storm surge or flooding as Alfred continued its track towards the populated south-east Queensland coast. \\nWhen and where is Tropical Cyclone Alfred going to hit? \\nThe bureau’s track maps include a large area in grey outside the main track that represents the area where the cyclone could go. \\nIn advice published at 7.52am Queensland time (8.52 AEDT) on Friday, the BoM said the centre of Alfred was expected to cross the Queensland coast at about 10am on Saturday morning, most likely between Double Island Point and Noosa and just south of Brisbane’s CBD. Staying up to date with the maps is the best way to stay informed. \\nAt 9am Queensland time (10am AEDT) on Friday, the BoM said Alfred remained a category 2 system with sustained winds near the centre of 100km/h with wind gusts to 140km/h. It was still moving slowly towards the coast, 160km east of Brisbane and 135km east-north-east of the Gold Coast. \\n \\n  Related: Why did Tropical Cyclone Alfred slow down on its destructive path towards Australia’s east coast?  \\n \\nThe centre of the cyclone was expected to cross over the Moreton Bay Islands on Saturday morning before crossing the mainland coast, most likely between Noosa and Beenleigh, later during Saturday. \\nCommunities from Double Island Point in Queensland to Grafton in NSW – including Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Byron Bay and Ballina but not including Grafton – were in the warning zone as of Friday morning. \\nSince Thursday night, the strongest wind gusts have been seen at Cape Byron, where there was a mean wind speed of 92km/h and gusting up to 120km/h. Gold Coast airport also experienced 100km/h wind gusts, with Evans Head and Cape Morton seeing 98km/h wind gusts. \\nDestructive wind gusts of up to 155km/h may develop about the Moreton Bay Islands and exposed coastal locations on the northern Gold Coast from Friday night, the BoM said, as Alfred’s destructive core approaches the coast. \\nCyclones rotate clockwise, meaning the strongest onshore winds are underneath the eye. \\n \\n Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\nPotentially life-threatening floods \\nAs well as high winds and storm surges, affected areas were preparing for intense rainfall that the bureau warned could lead to life-threatening flash flooding. \\n“Unfortunately, the northern river systems and New South Wales are already on their way to major flooding,” said Sarah Scully, a senior meteorologist at the BoM. \\nThe Bellinger River in NSW was already at moderate flood level on Friday morning. Major flood warnings have also been issued for the Logan, Tweed, Brunswick, Wilson, Richmond, Orara, Bellinger and Nambucca rivers of NSW, with more flood warnings and watches likely to be upgraded over the coming days. \\n \\n  Related: Cyclone Alfred update: storm may weaken as it makes landfall but winds and torrential rain batter Australia’s coast  \\n \\nIn the 48 hours to 6am Friday AEDT, parts of NSW had already seen hundreds of millimetres of rain, with 440mm falling at Meldrum, 429mm at Dorrigo and 321mm at Mullumbimbi. The rain has been slightly lighter in Queensland: 246mm at Lower Springbrook, 206mm at Currumbin Creek and 170mm at Coolangatta. \\nScully said Brisbane had experienced far lighter rainfall totals and was yet to see any of the gale-force winds because it was far more sheltered from the south and further away from the coast. \\n“We are expecting Brisbane winds to start to build throughout today and into this afternoon, and also the rainfall to increase as well,” she said. \\nAbnormally high tides are also expected to continue to cause flooding to low-lying areas between Double Island Point and Ballina, particularly during the high tide early on Saturday night. Damaging surf and significant beach erosion is likely for the open beaches between Double Island Point and Grafton, and further south over the NSW coast. \\nWhich suburbs are at risk? \\nEarlier in the week the Brisbane lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, said the suburbs “most at risk” were beachside communities – including Nudgee Beach and Brighton – and low-lying suburbs near rivers and creeks, including Windsor, Ashgrove, Morningside and Rocklea. \\nSouth of the city, Redland city council has issued warnings for a “very dangerous storm tide” for coastal areas. \\nGold Coast city council is warning of destructive wind gusts and significant flooding. \\nEvacuation centres \\nBrisbane city council has set up a temporary refuge shelter at RNA showgrounds, and two further shelters would be set up on Friday “if required” at the Chandler arena in Chandler and Kedron Wavell in Chermside. More information can be found on the council’s website. \\nGold Coast city council has opened evacuation centres at Runaway Bay indoor sports centre, Burleigh Waters community centre and Pimpama sports hub. \\nMoreton Bay had three evacuation centres open by Friday morning, at Caboolture memorial hall, Strathpine community centre and the Hope Centre in Rothwell. \\nIn NSW multiple evacuation centres have been set up all the way down the coast from the Queensland border as far south as Port Macquarie. A full list of centres with their opening times is on the NSW SES website.  \\nWhy is this a big deal? \\nTropical cyclones are typically a tropical phenomenon and the fact that Alfred could reach the coastline hundreds of kilometres south of the tropics could be quite dangerous. \\nThere is a huge population in the potential path of the cyclone of more than 4 million people, most of them living in and around Brisbane. And the Queensland capital is not particularly well-equipped to cope with a cyclone. \\nResidents of north Queensland and the Northern Territory are well-versed in preparing for cyclones; most have a cyclone kit with emergency supplies, and many buildings and homes are constructed to withstand strong winds. \\n \\n  Related: Fallen trees, howling wind and drunken parrots: bracing for Alfred, I remember another Queensland cyclone  \\n \\nBrisbane is also used to storms but doesn’t cope particularly well with them. The city has severely flooded three times (in 2011, 2017 and 2022) in the past 15 years. Predictions of 300mm to 600mm of rainfall in some areas, after a particularly wet summer, are worrying authorities. \\nIt is unusual to be taking the threat of a cyclone this seriously this far from it making landfall. But authorities are taking this very seriously. \\nWhen was the last cyclone in Brisbane? \\nIt is rare – but not unheard of – for tropical cyclones to reach landfall south of the tropics. \\nThe closest a cyclone track has come to Brisbane was in 1990 when Tropical Cyclone Nancy tracked erratically towards the Queensland capital before taking a southward turn just off the coastline and never making landfall. \\nTropical Cyclone Wanda – the cause of Brisbane’s historic 1974 floods – crossed the coast near K’gari and Hervey Bay. A severe tropical cyclone crossed the coast near Tweed Heads in 1954. \\nIt is far more common for a tropical cyclone to cross the coast north of the Tropic of Capricorn and return overland to the south-east as a destructive low storm. This occurred with Cyclone Debbie in 2017. \\nHow should people prepare? \\nThe Queensland government has a guide for residents to get ready for cyclones, which includes packing a kit with enough basic items for your family to use for three days at home without power. \\nResidents should make sure loose items are secured or put away. \\nHow will travel and public transport be affected? \\nOn Friday morning, Qantas announced an extension of its suspension of all flights – including budget carrier Jetstar – out of Brisbane, Gold Coast and Ballina airports until at least Sunday morning. Virgin operations are also suspended in those airports until at least Sunday morning. \\nAll bus, train, ferry and tram services in south-east Queensland have been suspended until further notice. Updates will be provided on the Department of Transport and Main Roads website. \\nThe department also said it expected damage to roads and bridges due to flooding as well as high winds. \\nThe Brisbane regional harbour master has issued a red alert for those on boats to seek/take shelter, and no vessels are permitted on the water until further notice.  \\nNSW and Queensland school closures \\nHundreds of schools across south-east Queensland and northern NSW will be closed on Friday, with 1,051 schools closed in Queensland including 663 state schools, and 254 NSW public schools, along with some independent schools. \\nTafes and universities – including the University of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland University of Technology, the University of Queensland and Griffith – have closed their campuses. \\nTheme parks closure extended \\nVillage Roadshow said the closure of Gold Coast theme parks, including Movie World, Sea World and Wet’n’Wild, would be extended to Sunday, but it would “provide updates as the situation progresses”. \\nRead more of Guardian Australia’s Tropical Cyclone Alfred coverage: \\n \\n Tropical Cyclone Alfred LIVE: latest news and updates \\n How BoM modelling predicts the path of cyclones like Alfred \\n Why did Tropical Cyclone Alfred slow down on its path towards the east coast? \\n Is climate change supercharging Tropical Cyclone Alfred as it powers towards Australia? \\n',\n",
       " '‘Like a cat in a washing machine’: rescued rower feared he would die in Cyclone Alfred’s monster waves [2025-03-07T03:00:48Z]': 'Aurimas Mockus finally made it to Australia, but not in the manner he imagined. Instead of triumphantly paddling in on the Kursis, the one-seater boat he’d been rowing for nearly five months across the Pacific Ocean as part of a solo mission from San Diego to Brisbane, he arrived in Sydney Harbour, relieved and alive, onboard a 16,000 tonne Australian naval ship. Had it not been for Tropical Cyclone Alfred, he likely would have completed the 12,000km journey, and joined just a handful of people to have rowed across the Pacific solo.   Related: Cyclone Alfred live updates: Brisbane, Queensland and NSW BoM path tracking map; landfall time and category; weather forecasts TC Alfred rain and flooding warnings –\\xa0latest Australia news    But Alfred, which was directly in the path of the Lithuanian rower, thwarted him. Monster seas hit the Kursis, causing it to roll over and over again and again. For three days, he could not rest or sleep as he battled giant waves, in a boat constantly filling with seawater and all communication with his support team lost. “I was like a cat in a washing machine,” he told reporters at the HMAS Kuttabul naval base in Potts Point, just east of Sydney’s CBD, on Friday morning after disembarking from HMAS Choules and finally, after nearly five months at sea, touching dry land.   Interactive   More seriously, he said, his voice breaking, he knows he was very close to death. As his boat flipped again and again in giant seas, he focused his energy on keeping the promise to his wife and teenage children when he embarked on the journey last year: that he would return to them. “[I was] rolling maybe 30 times, I’m not counting them, maybe more. Many times [I thought] may be last time,” he said.   Related: Tropical Cyclone Alfred approaches the Queensland coast – in pictures    “These last three days in the ocean … I have to – many times, many hours – fight [for] my life, because … my boat is sinking; all navigation … stops, I just have VHF radio, I have problems in my body. I feel like, if I lost my mind, if I lost my belief [that] I can fight for my life, I [would not be here] together with you today. “Now I know … hell is not … hot, it’s actually wet and very strong winds.” Mockus’s wife, Sonata Mockuviene, was at the naval base in Sydney waiting to greet her husband, whom she had not seen since he set off from San Diego on the US west coast in mid-October. She flew in to Australia from Lithuania on Thursday. ‘We were worried, it was too long’ After walking down the gangway from the ship, Mockus fell to his knees in front of his wife and, sobbing, buried his face in her stomach, as she hugged his head and kissed him. Mockuviene said the rowing trip was not the craziest thing her husband had ever done, but it was the “longest crazy” he had attempted. She was in almost daily contact with him throughout the journey, receiving a message or short phone call to hear that he was safe and well. But last week the communications stopped. “When he missed all the connections, we did not have any information, we were worried, it was too long … not getting the message from him,” she said.    Then, at about 10pm on Friday 28 February, Mockus activated his emergency SOS beacon, transmitting a signal to a satellite that bounced to a 24/7 response centre in Canberra, and setting off a chain of action that would eventually lead to his dramatic rescue from cyclone-battered high seas by HMAS Choules. “As you can imagine, it’s no small task finding an object that small in the middle of our ocean,” said Mark Morrow, the executive director of response for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa), which coordinated the search for Mockus. Adding to the difficulty was the cyclone, which was producing winds in excess of 130km/h and heavy seas in excess of nine metres. “Normally, we would be in a position where we could divert a vessel to assist us,” said Kevin McEvoy, the Amsa response centre manager. But TC Alfred meant that there were no ships in the area. “We didn’t have that luxury.”    Mockus was eventually spotted by a Challenger aircraft. Amsa was able to make radio contact with Mockus, using a Lithuanian translator, whom Mockus thanked emotionally on Friday. The team made six flights over three days, maintaining contact with him. Mockus’s voice broke as he recounted seeing the aircraft above him for the first time. “I thought I am not alone. But how he can help, I don’t know.” HMAS Choules was deployed from Brisbane and Mockus was rescued on Monday. “I don’t have words for this,” Mockus said, when asked how he felt to see the Royal Australian Navy vessel coming to his aid. “Just love.”    Their journey back to Sydney was fraught. HMAS Choules encountered 12-metre seas and was pitched on 28 degree rolls – or a 90ft roll from one side to the other – causing some damage to equipment onboard the ship, including sending hospital beds through bulkheads, though no one was injured. Mockus said that after being brought aboard HMAS Choules and being checked by medical staff – he has some cuts and bruises from being thrown around in the savage conditions, but nothing serious or life-threatening – he was just focused on getting horizontal. “When I’m sinking, I’m thinking about a clear bed, because three, four days, I spent in the wet and rolling sea.” Elation An elated Darius Degutis, the Lithuanian ambassador to Australia, thanked the Australian government, defence force and people for the rescue. “It’s a very special day, because we have Aurimas. We have a saying in Lithuanian language, sveikas ir gyvas, healthy and alive. He is healthy and alive.” Degutis read aloud a letter from the foreign minister of Lithuania thanking Australia for rescuing the rower. “Lithuania is profoundly grateful to your unwavering commitment to saving lives and we will always remember this extraordinary act of solidarity and cooperation,” the letter said.    For now, Mockus and his wife will spend some time in Australia before returning to their children in Lithuania. Mockus said he had no regrets about the trip. But asked if he would be attempting it again, to see if he can complete the voyage, he laughed. “Not yet,” he said. When Mockuviene was asked if she would approve of his husband trying again, she said it was out of her hands. “I cannot keep him … at the house.

       " 'NSW and Queensland floods update: Ipswich avoids severe flooding by inches as more rain forecast in wake of Cyclone Alfred [2025-03-11T08:38:48Z]': 'The cleanup has begun in flood-affected parts of Queensland but thousands of homes will remain without power until the weekend.  All police emergency warnings for the region have been cancelled after the rain caused by ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred eased. Dylan Gatt and his two housemates evacuated their rental house in Woolloongabba’s Churchill Street. “This is the third time it’s flooded since we’ve been here, which is only six months,” he told the Guardian. Teams of volunteers from the Queensland Greens have helped Gatt clean up the home. The lower levels of many homes in the Brisbane suburb were inundated by flash flooding from Norman Creek. Gatt said he and his house mates don’t feel safe in the home, but had few options because the rental market was so tight. “We feel very on edge,” he said.

Energex is aiming to reconnect power to 95% of those dwellings by Friday. Power has been returned to all critical infrastructure, like water treatment plans and mobile phone towers, according to Essential Energy. But thousands of homes and businesses in suburbs such as Greenbank, Capalaba, Alexandra Hills and Currumbin Waters are not scheduled to get power back until Saturday night. About 551 customers in Logan Village, south of Brisbane, won’t be reconnected until Sunday.    Local MPs representing Greenbank are concerned about elderly residents in the community. “It’ll be over a week that these people haven’t had power,” the Labor MP for Jordan, Charis Mullen said. More than 330,000 homes have had power restored in what is by “far the biggest electricity reconnection in Queensland we’ve ever had,” a spokesperson for Energex said.  Meanwhile, many residents in the state’s south-east are breathing a sigh of relief at avoiding a repeat of the 2022 flood.    Related: ‘Cabin fever’ and Covid-19 flashbacks: how ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred is upending Brisbane life    The city of Ipswich narrowly avoided severe flooding overnight, after the Bremer River peaked just below the “major” flood level. Parts of the Ipswich CBD and some suburbs had been inundated, and residents had been nervously watching the river height in the early hours of Tuesday.  The town of Laidley was flooded on Monday and the flood siren at Grantham – a legacy of the 2011 flooding that devastated the town – was sounded, warning residents to leave. Generally, the severity of rainfall brought by ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred had eased on Tuesday.   Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email  In Brisbane, flash flooding occurred in city creeks early on Monday, after the city recorded 275.2mm in the 24 hours to 9am, the largest single-day rainfall since the city’s 1974 floods. Flooding occurred in similar places to 2022, but the creeks subsided through Monday morning. ‘Significant’ economic impact A record 450,000 people in the south-east have been affected by power outages since Thursday. The premier, David Crisafulli, said the State Emergency Service received 3,500 jobs in 24 hours on Sunday: “The most ever recorded.” He said the recovery is going to be a “big effort” and the economic impact “significant”.

We have to make sure that every single person is given the opportunity to get life back to normal, and that work is certainly under way.” Commonwealth personal hardship grants worth $180 for individuals or $900 for families have been activated for Redlands, Gold Coast, Logan, Moreton Bay, as well as for targeted areas in the Fraser Coast, adding to councils already covered. The area was slowly returning to normal, with supermarkets, airports and select Brisbane bus services operating again. However, the Warrego Highway connecting Brisbane to Toowoomba remained closed until further notice. South of the border, residents have returned home after evacuation orders were lifted in some northern New South Wales towns. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said evacuation centres for 700 people must close once warnings were lifted because they were not meant to be a long-term fix.  About 1,800 people were isolated by flood waters in NSW on Monday and more than 10,000 people were under emergency warnings.'}"
