    "Using the code for accessing an API that was used in the lecture, retrieve data from an API that interests you.\n",

    "Start with one from this list that has `No` in the Auth column: [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)\n",

    "You may also like to explore this site: [AnyAPI](https://any-api.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to try an API that requires authentication, the following code provides a common approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "request = urllib.request.Request('http://mysite/admin/index.cgi?index=127')\n",
    "base64string = base64.b64encode(bytes('%s:%s' % ('login', 'password'),'ascii'))\n",

    "resulttext = result.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this will depend on the API, and you may need to read the API documentation to work out how to authenticate. Some sites may require you to create an account and use an authentication token. Most sites will have examples of how to use their APIs.\n"

    "Use regular expressions (regex) to extract (1) the timestamp, (2) the error level, and (3) the message. You may find this [cheat sheet](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/regex-cheatsheet/) helpful. You can also test your regex at [regex101.com](https://regex101.com)\n",

    "You could try parsing the log file into both Json format and into a pandas dataframe. You could use the Json structure for the task [3] below, and you could use the pandas dataframe to address questions like: 'do certain errors occur on some days more than others?'\n"
