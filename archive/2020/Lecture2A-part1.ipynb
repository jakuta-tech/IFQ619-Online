    "Naive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values. There is not a single algorithm for training such classifiers, but a family of algorithms based on a common principle: all naive Bayes classifiers assume that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature, given the class variable. For instance, if we want to describe an apple, features such as  color or shape would be considered independent from the fruit and with different probability distributions. In this workshop, we will explore two major algorithms for training a Naive Bayes classifier: the Gaussian Naive Bayes and the MultinomialNaive Baayes (there are others, of course).\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstractly, naive Bayes is a conditional probability model: given a problem instance to be classified, represented by a vector $x =(x_{1},\\dots ,x_{n})$, representing some *N* features or pieces of evidence (independent variables), it assigns to this instance probabilities\n",

    "\n",
    "for each of K possible outcomes or classes, $C_K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the above formulation is that if the number of features n is large or if a feature can take on a large number of values, then basing such a model on probability tables is infeasible. We therefore reformulate the model to make it more tractable. Using Bayes' theorem, the conditional probability can be decomposed as\n",

    "$ Pr( C | x_1, x_2, ..., x_N ) = \\frac{Pr(C) Pr(x_1, x_2, ..., x_N | C)}{Pr( x_1, x_2, ..., x_N)} $\n",

This machine learning system will output a mathematical function, which approximates the patterns and trends of the input training data. In machine learning, this function is usually referred to as a model. This model is computed through optimization problems that try to minimize the error between each datapoint during the training phase and its correct prediction. That is whay it is called *supervised* learning: one always needs to provide information about the true predictions of the data.\n",
