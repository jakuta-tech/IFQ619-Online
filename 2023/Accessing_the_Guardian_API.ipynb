To date, requests from Germany, Spain and Denmark have been rejected under the War Materiel Act, which bars all re-export if the recipient country is in an international armed conflict. Berset told NZZ the policy was based on “commitment to peace, to humanitarian law, to mediation where possible”.</p> <p>Berset told NZZ the policy was based on “commitment to peace, to humanitarian law, to mediation where possible”. Switzerland’s role as the seat of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Geneva Conventions, as well as of the United Nations’s European headquarters “is reflected in our laws, including those relating to the export of weapons”, he said. Protection of humanitarian and human rights law and the Geneva Conventions “may sound passé to some, but it is more important than ever,” he said, warning it would be “extremely dangerous to throw these fundamental principles overboard now”. “As far as Switzerland is concerned, warfare is not part of the DNA,” Berset said, stressing his nation aimed “to be present wherever we can contribute to mediation and peace”. He said he believed negotiations with Russia were needed to end the war in Ukraine, “the sooner the better”.</p> <p>Several initiatives are under way in parliament towards relaxing the re-export rules to make it possible for Swiss-made weaponry to be transferred by third countries to Ukraine.

allowing Ukrainian grain blockaded by Russia’s invasion to be exported safely from three ports.</p> <p>The deal was extended for 120 days in November and will renew on 18 March if no party objects.

We believe it will conclude positively,” Akar said in an interview with state-owned Anadolu Agency reported by Reuters.</p> <p>“We have the opinion that the duration will be extended on 18 March,.”</p> <p>The west has not explicitly targeted Russia’s agricultural exports, but Moscow says sanctions on its payments, logistics and insurance industries are a barrier to it being able to export its grain and fertilisers.</p> <p>Russia has also complained that Ukrainian grain exported under the deal is going to wealthy countries.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2023-03-12T11:30:34.316Z\">at 11.30am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-640da7e28f088ed9e33674ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-03-12T10:30:44.891Z\">10.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson <strong>Maria Zakharova</strong> has reportedly said there is infighting in the Kremlin’s inner circle, and that the Kremlin has in effect ceded control over the country’s information space.</p> <p>Speaking at a forum on Saturday on the “practical and technological aspects of information and cognitive warfare in modern realities” in Moscow, Zakharova mentioned that despite fighting among unspecified Kremlin “elites”, the Kremlin could not replicate the Stalinist approach of establishing a modern equivalent to the Soviet Information Bureau, the <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-march-11-2023\">Institute for the Study of War said</a> in its latest assessment.</p> <p>The ISW added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Zakharova’s statement is noteworthy and supports several of ISW’s longstanding assessments about deteriorating Kremlin regime and information space control dynamics.

Russia’s defence ministry said up to 210 Ukrainian soldiers were killed in the broader Donetsk part of the frontline.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9cdaa9cd9049c338bca3827b1b3693461e7b6a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9cdaa9cd9049c338bca3827b1b3693461e7b6a5/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukrainian servicemen prepare to join the front line near Bakhmut in the Donbas region.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ukrainian servicemen prepare to join the front line near Bakhmut in the Donbas region.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>British military intelligence said on Saturday that Russia’s Wagner mercenary group had taken control of most of the eastern part of Bakhmut – an advance that the group’s founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, claimed on Wednesday.</p> <p>“In the city centre, the Bakhmutka River now marks the frontline,” the British defence ministry said in its daily intelligence bulletin.</p> <p>Moscow says capturing Bakhmut would punch a hole in Ukrainian defences and be a step towards seizing all of the Donbas industrial region, a major target.

Baerbock urged China to step up to exert its influence on Russia over Ukraine.

joined the Nato military alliance to complete a security U-turn taken in response to the war in Ukraine, Reuters reports.</p> \\n  <p>Fearing retaliation from the east following its Nato application, the government decided last year to construct the barrier, primarily in case Russia moved to flood the border with migrants.</p> \\n  <p>Made of steel mesh, the Finnish fence is scheduled to cover some 200 kilometres (125 miles) of the most critical parts of its border by the end of 2026.

And Finland needs to be less dependent on the Russian border control,” he added.</p> \\n  <p>Poland and the Baltic states have already begun erecting fences on their borders with Russia and Belarus following the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p> \\n  <p>Until now, the Finnish-Russian border has been a mere line in the vast forests covering the area, marked only by a low wire fence intended to stop cattle and other domestic animals but not people.</p> \\n  <p>The new fence will be 3 metres (10ft) high, topped with razor wire and tracked by a road, and cost an estimated €380m (£335m).</p>

But when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion last year, senior commanders eager to seize momentum and skeptical of their conventional fighters’ prowess deviated from the norm, ordering elite forces into direct combat, according to US intelligence findings and independent analysts who have closely followed spetsnaz deployments.</p> \\n   <p>The rapid depletion of Russia’s commando units, observers say, shifted the war’s dynamic from the outset, severely limiting Moscow’s ability to employ clandestine tactics in support of conventional combat operations. US officials believe that the staggering casualties these units have sustained will render them less effective, not only in Ukraine but also in other parts of the world where Russian forces operate, according to the assessments, which range in date from late 2022 to earlier this year.</p> \\n  </blockquote> \\n </div> \\n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2023-04-14T13:06:21.519Z\">at 2.06pm BST</time></p> \\n</div> \\n<div id=\"block-643946348f08791e579d4e82\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \\n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-04-14T13:00:33.802Z\">2.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \\n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary of the day so far …</h2> \\n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \\n  <ul> \\n   <li><p><strong>The UK’s Ministry of Defence has claimed in its daily intelligence briefing that Ukrainian troops have been forced to make ‘orderly withdrawals’ from positions they previously held in the highly contested town of Bakhmut, and that the last two days have seen an intense artillery bombardment from Russian forces.</strong></p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>A Russian Su-35 aircraft carried out airstrikes on the settlement of Orihiv in the Zaporizhzhia region</strong>, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office said on Friday.<strong> </strong>In a post on Telegram, Andriy Yermak said private houses and the building of the DYSSH were damaged.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Ukraine will “test and use” any non-banned weapons to liberate its territory, including Russian-occupied Crimea</strong>, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council has said.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Rishi Sunak denounced a video on Friday purporting to show the beheading of a Ukrainian prisoner of war</strong> and said those responsible should be brought to book.

However “in reality, much of the area remains an active combat zone, subject to partisan attacks, and with extremely limited access to basic services for many citizens”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A Ukrainian government minister is due to visit India on</strong> <strong>Monday and will seek humanitarian aid and equipment to repair energy infrastructure damaged during Russia’s invasion</strong>, according to the Hindu newspaper.

Kara-Murza holds dual Russian-British citizenship.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Kara-Murza’s wife, Evgenia Kara-Murza, told British broadcaster LBC that she was “baffled” by the UK government’s “weak” response</strong>. “Introducing sanctions against his perpetrators would actually be a very practical step that I would very much like to see,” she said.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>The UN’s human rights head, Volker Türk, urged Russia to release him, while Baltic neighbour Latvia sanctioned 10 Russian officials and lawyers</strong> involved in the case.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>US ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy said she had made her first visit to jailed Wall Street reporter Evan Gershkovich</strong>, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/russia-arrests-wall-street-journal-reporter-on-espionage-charges-evan-gershkovich\">arrested in Russia</a> two weeks ago on charges of spying. “He feels well and is holding up. We reiterate our call for Evan’s immediate release,” Tracy said.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>The United States and more than 40 other countries said in a joint statement that they were deeply concerned over Russia’s detainment of a Wall Street Journal reporter</strong> and protested Moscow’s “efforts to limit and intimidate the media.” The statement read further: “We urge Russian Federation authorities to release those they hold on political grounds, and to end the draconian crackdown on freedom of expression, including against members of the media.”</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Two Russian fighter jets and a spy plane flying close to Nato airspace have been intercepted by the UK and German air forces</strong>. Eurofighter typhoons from the RAF and the German air force’s 71 Richtofen Wing were scrambled to intercept the jets as they flew over the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Finland.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>The Pentagon said it expected findings within 45 days from a review into how the US military handles classified information</strong> after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/13/pentagon-leaked-documents-suspect-arrested\">last week’s arrest</a> of an airman over the leak a trove of highly classified documents online.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Russia said it had repelled an “illegal” Ukrainian attempt to infiltrate Russian territory in the southern border region of Bryansk</strong>, 11 days after reporting a similar incident. “The intruder stepped on a mined protection line,” said regional governor Alexander Bogomaz on Telegram.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Slovakia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/slovakia-joins-poland-hungary-halting-ukraine-grain-imports\">will temporarily halt</a> imports of grains and other selected products from Ukraine to protect its farmers</strong>, joining Poland and Hungary in the move, a government spokesperson said on Monday. Ukraine and Poland meanwhile began talks aimed at reaching an agreement on imports.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Slovakia</strong> <strong>has handed over all 13 MiG-29 fighter jets it had pledged to Ukraine</strong>, the Slovak defence ministry.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Almost 500 children have been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, according to a report by the Ukrainian prosecutor general</strong>. As of Monday, 470 children had been killed and 948 injured, it said, adding that the department believes that the number of injured children is higher.</p></li> \\n  </ul> \\n </div> \\n</div>'},\n",

My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next while.</p> \\n  <p>Our top story this morning: ex-Soviet Moldova is no longer receiving Russian gas or enduring the “blackmail” imposed by gas giant Gazprom over its difficulties in paying for supplies, the country’s energy minister said.</p> \\n  <p>Moldova, one of Europe’s poorest countries, has been buffeted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the presence of pro-Russian separatists on its doorstep.</p> \\n  <p>Led by pro-European President Maia Sandu, Moldova accuses Russia of plotting to destabilise it.</p> \\n  <p>We’ll have more on this and other news shortly.</p> \\n  <p>Here are the key recent developments:</p> \\n  <ul> \\n   <li><p><strong>Moscow said Wednesday it would try to retrieve the wreckage of a US military drone that crashed over the Black Sea,</strong> in a confrontation Washington blamed on two Russian fighter jets. US officials said the debris could be in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/15/russian-us-drone-jet-recovery\"> such deep water that recovery is impossible</a>, and would have no real intelligence value.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>The Russian and US defence ministers and military chiefs held rare phone conversations on Wednesday to discuss the incident</strong>. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told his US counterpart Lloyd Austin on Wednesday that operating drone flights near Crimea was provocative and could lead to an escalation, the Russian Defence Ministry said. Russia, the statement said, “had no interest in such a development but will in future react in due proportion”.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Austin declined to offer any details on the call, including whether he criticised the Russian intercept. </strong>But he reiterated at a news conference that the US intended to continue flying where international law allowed and demanded Russian military aircraft operate in a safe and professional manner.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said that the incident was “being investigated”. </strong>Blinken declined to speak to the motive or intent behind the incident, saying he would let the investigation proceed and that the US is “in close coordination” with allies and partners on the matter.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, accused Russia of acting “unprofessionally”. </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/15/russian-downing-of-us-drone-unprofessional-says-uk-defence-secretary-ben-wallace\">Wallace’s comments</a> reflect an emerging western view that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/14/russian-fighter-jet-collides-us-drone-black-sea-crash\">the extraordinary mid-air incident</a> was a one-off, not immediately meriting anything stronger than diplomatic complaints.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>The Kremlin said on earlier on Wednesday that relations with the US were in a “lamentable state” and at their lowest level, </strong>after Washington accused Russia of downing one of its reconnaissance drones over the Black Sea.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Elsewhere, Ukrainian ground forces shot down a Russian fighter jet near the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut,</strong> a Ukrainian official <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/15/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-should-respect-international-airspace-says-uk-defence-minister-after-drone-crash?page=with:block-6411fec48f08384b8c708679#block-6411fec48f08384b8c708679\">has said. </a>Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, also said Kyiv’s forces had made gains in northern parts of the city.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian mercenary Wagner group, said Russian forces had taken control of the settlement of Zaliznyanskoye and are expanding the encirclement of Bakhmut. </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/15/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-should-respect-international-airspace-says-uk-defence-minister-after-drone-crash?page=with:block-6411fec48f08384b8c708679#block-6411fec48f08384b8c708679\">Neither side’s claims of success </a>in what has become the longest-running battle since the war began could be verified.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Ex-Soviet Moldova is no longer receiving Russian gas or enduring the “blackmail” imposed by gas giant Gazprom over its difficulties in paying for supplies,</strong> the country’s energy minister said. Victor Parlicov, speaking to TV8 television on Wednesday evening, said Gazprom had been providing supplies only to Moldova’s Russian-backed Transnistria separatist region since December, with none going to central authorities in Chisinau.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Russia’s defence ministry will start a new recruitment campaign on 1 April, with the aim of recruiting 400,000 professional soldiers to the Russian army,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/15/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-should-respect-international-airspace-says-uk-defence-minister-after-drone-crash?page=with:block-6411bfbf8f089dc4386c2b28#block-6411bfbf8f089dc4386c2b28\">according to a report.</a> Russian military recruitment offices are trying to compensate for its losses in specialised soldiers, such as tank drivers and artillerymen, according to a separate report.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Turkey’s parliament is “highly likely” to ratify Finland’s Nato accession bid before mid-April,</strong> two Turkish officials told Reuters. Sweden and Finland applied last year to join the defence pact after Russia invaded Ukraine but faced objections from Turkey.</p></li> \\n  </ul> \\n </div> \\n</div>'},\n",

President Putin’s dangerous nuclear rhetoric has had a further destabilising impact.”</p> \\n<p>Last week, China’s president, Xi Jinping, travelled to Russia for a meeting with Putin, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/21/putin-welcomes-chinas-controversial-proposals-for-peace-in-ukraine\">welcomed Beijing’s proposals for peace in Ukraine</a>. That plan urged all parties to avoid nuclear escalation but, critically, did not suggest Russia withdraw its forces.</p> \\n<p>In the days after the visit, Putin announced that Moscow had made a deal to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/25/russia-to-station-tactical-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus\">station tactical nuclear weapons</a> on Belarusian territory.</p> \\n<p>The Dfat documents show how Wong planned to raise human rights with her Chinese counterpart by suggesting that China was not being singled out.</p> \\n<p>“Australia is committed to advancing human rights globally. That is why we advocate for human rights in other countries, including China,” the notes said.</p> \\n<p>In her press conference in Beijing after the meeting, Wong confirmed she had raised human rights, along with the cases of detained Australian citizens and ongoing “trade blockages”.</p> \\n<p>Many parts of the document are redacted, because of the potential impact on diplomatic relations.</p> \\n<p>Wong has always been keen to avoid use of the term “reset” when talking about China, because that implies a fundamental shift in Australia’s policy positions. She has instead called for both countries to navigate their enduring differences “wisely”.</p> \\n<p>James Laurenceson, the director of the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney, said on Monday that he was upbeat about the prospects for the relationship in 2023.</p> \\n<p>“The relationship has a bit more resilience and stability in it now because both sides have agreed to re-engage with realistic expectations,” he said.</p> \\n<p>Laurenceson noted that even a week after the Aukus announcement, the Chinese ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, wrote an <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/policy/foreign-affairs/china-australia-relationship-is-returning-to-the-right-track-20230320-p5ctqc\">oped in the Australian Financial Review</a> that said the two countries were “well positioned to become peacefully coexisting and mutually beneficial partners”.</p> \\n<p>Xiao wrote that the relationship was “picking up a positive trend of stabilisation and improvement” and China stood ready to work with Australia to “objectively view and properly handle differences”.</p> \\n<p>Laurenceson, who has long argued that defence policies such as Aukus were already baked in to Beijing’s calculations, said he did not think the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/14/what-is-the-aukus-submarine-deal-and-what-does-it-mean-the-key-facts\">San Diego announcement</a> would throw the broader diplomatic effort off-course.</p> \\n<p>“There was diplomatic grumbling in Beijing by the foreign ministry but beyond that there was nothing,” he said.</p> \\n<p>Laurenceson predicted further easing of China’s trade actions against Australian export sectors through the course of 2023, although that was likely to be a gradual process.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/21/10-years-strengthening-ties-between-putin-xi-china-russia\">‘He is my best friend’: 10 years of strengthening ties between Putin and Xi</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>The assistant trade minister, Tim Ayres, is due to arrive in China on Tuesday to attend the <a href=\"https://english.boaoforum.org/\">Bo’ao Forum for Asia</a> annual conference – the first attendance by an Australian government minister in this event since 2016.</p> \\n<p>The trip is likely to help pave the way for a future trip by the trade minister, Don Farrell, as soon as April. </p> \\n<p>The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said there had been some progress in removing trade impediments.</p> \\n<p>The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/27/daniel-andrews-to-begin-trade-trip-to-china-amid-criticism-over-transparency\">also making his way to China this week</a>, while the West Australian premier, Mark McGowan, plans to travel there soon.</p>'},\n",
